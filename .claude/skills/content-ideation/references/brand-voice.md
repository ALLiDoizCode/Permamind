- Highlight practical use cases
- Give credit to other projects and contributors

### Don't:
- Use hype or buzzwords without substance ("revolutionary", "game-changing")
- Make absolute claims without evidence
- Oversimplify blockchain/AI concepts
- Be promotional or sales-focused
- Use Web3 jargon without explanation for newcomers
- Promise what we can't deliver
- Ignore limitations or challenges
- Take credit for others' work
- Use "crypto bro" or "to the moon" language

## Example Sentences

### ✅ Good Examples:
- "We've found that most developers struggle with AO process state persistence. Here's how Permamind solves this using permanent memory on Arweave..."
- "There are three approaches to AI memory: centralized databases, local storage, or permanent decentralized storage. Each has trade-offs..."
- "The Permaweb enables something unique: truly permanent AI context. Here's how it works under the hood..."
- "This approach works well for conversational agents, though real-time applications may need additional caching layers."
- "Shoutout to the AO team for their excellent documentation on process handlers - we built on their patterns here."

### ❌ Bad Examples:
- "Permamind is the ultimate revolutionary AI memory solution!"
- "Everyone is doing AI memory wrong except us."
- "You need Permamind to build successful AI applications."
- "Traditional databases are dead - decentralization is the only way."
- "To the moon! 🚀🚀🚀"

## Platform Adaptations

### Twitter/X
- **Tone**: Slightly more casual, timely, conversational
- **Format**: Threads for technical deep-dives, single tweets for updates
- **Engagement**: Ask questions, share learnings, highlight community
- **Examples**: "Just shipped: permanent memory for Claude agents. Here's what we learned building it 🧵"

### LinkedIn
- **Tone**: More professional, strategic insights, thought leadership
- **Format**: Long-form posts (1,300-1,900 chars), data-driven
- **Engagement**: Industry trends, case studies, technical architecture
- **Examples**: "The intersection of AI and decentralized storage: 3 architectural patterns we're seeing emerge..."

### Blog/Documentation
- **Tone**: Most technical, comprehensive, tutorial-focused
- **Format**: Long-form (1,500-3,000 words), code examples, diagrams
- **Engagement**: Deep dives, implementation guides, case studies
- **Examples**: "Building ADP-Compliant AO Processes: A Complete Guide"

### Discord/Community
- **Tone**: Helpful, authentic, peer-to-peer
- **Format**: Conversational, quick responses, code snippets
- **Engagement**: Answer questions, share updates, gather feedback
- **Examples**: "Good question! Here's how we handle that edge case in the MCP server..."

## Technical Terminology (Always Use Correctly)

### AO/Arweave Ecosystem:
- **AO Process**: Not "smart contract" or "program"
- **Handler**: Not "function" or "endpoint"
- **Message**: Not "transaction" or "call"
- **Permaweb**: Not "blockchain" or "Web3 storage"
- **ADP**: AO Documentation Protocol (always explain first use)

### Permamind Specific:
- **Permanent Memory**: Not "blockchain memory" or "decentralized storage"
- **MCP Server**: Model Context Protocol server (explain acronym)
- **Agent Skills**: Claude Code agent skills (not "plugins" or "extensions")
- **Memory Indexing**: Not "database" or "storage system"
