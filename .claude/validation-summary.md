### Command Files Structure

```
.claude/commands/
├── cleanup.md    ✅ Professional-grade legacy code analysis
├── tdd.md        ✅ Comprehensive test-driven development workflow
├── prepush.md    ✅ Complete pre-push validation and CI simulation
├── ship.md       ✅ Combined workflow orchestrator (NEW)
├── epcc.md       ✅ Explore, Plan, Code, Commit workflow
├── prime.md      ✅ Documentation context loader
└── visual.md     ✅ Visual development workflow
```

### Package.json Script Validation

All commands reference valid npm scripts:

- ✅ `npm run format` (code formatting)
- ✅ `npm run format:check` (format validation)
- ✅ `npm run lint` (linting with type check)
- ✅ `npm run lint:fix` (auto-fix linting issues)
- ✅ `npm run type-check` (TypeScript validation)
- ✅ `npm run test` (test execution)
- ✅ `npm run test:coverage` (coverage analysis)
- ✅ `npm run test:unit` (unit tests only)
- ✅ `npm run test:integration` (integration tests only)
- ✅ `npm run audit` (security audit)
- ✅ `npm run build` (TypeScript compilation)
- ✅ `npm run ci:quality` (complete quality pipeline)

### Test Infrastructure Validation

Complete testing setup exists:

- ✅ `vitest.config.ts` (main Vitest configuration)
- ✅ `vitest.unit.config.ts` (unit test configuration)
- ✅ `vitest.integration.config.ts` (integration test configuration)
- ✅ `tests/unit/` (comprehensive unit test directory)
- ✅ `tests/integration/` (integration test directory)
- ✅ `tests/e2e/` (end-to-end test directory)
- ✅ `tests/fixtures/` (test data fixtures)
- ✅ `tests/mocks/` (mock implementations)

### Git Hook Integration

Perfect integration with existing pre-push hook:

- ✅ **Existing Hook**: Handles debug log removal and WIP commit prevention
- ✅ **Commands**: Provide comprehensive validation and quality checks
- ✅ **No Conflicts**: Commands complement rather than duplicate hook functionality
- ✅ **Workflow**: `/ship` → automatic debug cleanup → quality validation → push

### Project Context

- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` created with comprehensive project context
- ✅ Architecture, coding standards, and patterns documented
- ✅ AO ecosystem integration patterns included
- ✅ MCP server development guidelines provided

## 🚀 Available Workflows

### Quick Development Cycle

```bash
# Load context and start development
/prime
/epcc "implement new feature"

# Quick pre-push validation
/ship quick
git push
```

### Complete Quality Assurance

```bash
# Load context
/prime

# Complete workflow before major push
/ship full

# Results in comprehensive validation:
# 1. Cleanup: Code quality analysis
# 2. TDD: Test coverage validation
# 3. Prepush: CI simulation and build validation
```

### Visual Development

```bash
# For UI/UX work
/prime
/visual "implement dashboard component"
# Iterative: code → screenshot → refine
```

### Legacy Code Improvement

```bash
# For cleanup and refactoring
/cleanup [target_area]
# Comprehensive analysis and action plan
```
