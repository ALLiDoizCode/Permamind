# Wallet Configuration
#
# SEED_PHRASE: Optional 12-word BIP39 mnemonic for deterministic wallet generation
#
# When set, the CLI will use this seed phrase to generate a deterministic Arweave wallet
# instead of loading a wallet from a file. This wallet will be used for all CLI operations
# that require signing (e.g., publishing skills).
#
# Security Warning:
# - NEVER commit .env files with real seed phrases to version control
# - Keep your seed phrase secure and private
# - Anyone with your seed phrase has full access to your wallet
#
# Priority:
# 1. SEED_PHRASE env var (highest priority)
# 2. --wallet flag (if provided)
# 3. Default wallet path ~/.arweave/wallet.json (fallback)
#
# Example (DO NOT use this in production):
# SEED_PHRASE=witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least

# SEED_PHRASE=

# AO Registry Configuration (Optional Overrides for Testing/Development)
#
# The registry configuration is now baked into the CLI package.
# You DO NOT need to set these variables for production use.
#
# These environment variables are only needed if you want to:
# - Test against a different registry process
# - Use alternative CU/MU endpoints
# - Use a different Arweave gateway
#
# Production defaults (used if not set):
# - AO_REGISTRY_PROCESS_ID: afj-S1wpWK07iSs9jIttoPJsptf4Db6ubZ_CLODdEpQ
# - AO_MU_URL: https://ur-mu.randao.net
# - AO_CU_URL: https://ur-cu.randao.net
# - ARWEAVE_GATEWAY: https://arweave.net
# - HYPERBEAM_NODE: https://hb.randao.net

# Turbo SDK Configuration (Epic 9: Free uploads for bundles < 100KB)
#
# TURBO_GATEWAY: Optional custom Turbo gateway URL
# TURBO_USE_CREDITS: Optional force credit-based uploads
#
# Turbo SDK enables FREE uploads for skill bundles < 100KB (subsidized by ArDrive/Turbo).
# These settings are OPTIONAL overrides for advanced use cases.
#
# Default behavior (when not set):
# - Uses Turbo's public gateway (https://upload.ardrive.io)
# - Automatically uses FREE tier for bundles < 100KB
# - Uses credit-based uploads for bundles >= 100KB (if Turbo credits available)
#
# When to override:
# - TURBO_GATEWAY: Use custom Turbo gateway (e.g., private Turbo instance)
# - TURBO_USE_CREDITS: Force credit-based uploads even for small bundles
#
# Security:
# - Gateway URL must use HTTPS protocol (HTTP not allowed)
# - Invalid URLs will cause validation errors
#
# Examples:
# TURBO_GATEWAY=https://upload.ardrive.io  # Custom gateway
# TURBO_USE_CREDITS=false                   # Use free tier (default)

# TURBO_GATEWAY=
# TURBO_USE_CREDITS=

# MCP Server Configuration (Optional)
#
# INSTALL_LOCATION: Custom directory for installing skills
#
# When set, the MCP server will install skills to this directory instead of
# the default location (~/.claude/skills). This is useful for:
# - Custom installation paths
# - Testing with isolated skill directories
# - Team-shared skill repositories
#
# Default: ~/.claude/skills (if not set)
#
# Example:
# INSTALL_LOCATION=/custom/path/to/skills

# INSTALL_LOCATION=
