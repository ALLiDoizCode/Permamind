# AO Registry Configuration (Optional Overrides for Testing/Development)
#
# The registry configuration is now baked into the CLI package.
# You DO NOT need to set these variables for production use.
#
# These environment variables are only needed if you want to:
# - Test against a different registry process
# - Use alternative CU/MU endpoints
# - Use a different Arweave gateway
#
# Production defaults (used if not set):
# - AO_REGISTRY_PROCESS_ID: afj-S1wpWK07iSs9jIttoPJsptf4Db6ubZ_CLODdEpQ
# - AO_MU_URL: https://ur-mu.randao.net
# - AO_CU_URL: https://ur-cu.randao.net
# - ARWEAVE_GATEWAY: https://arweave.net
# - HYPERBEAM_NODE: https://hb.randao.net
