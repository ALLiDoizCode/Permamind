# Pre-Push Hook Corruption Fix

## Issue Description

The pre-push hook was corrupting files by:

- Automatically modifying source files in the working directory
- Staging all changes with `git add -A` without user consent
- Using unsafe file processing that could corrupt uncommitted work

## Root Cause

- Lines 16-48: Destructive file modification using `mv "$temp_file" "$file"`
- Line 86: Unsafe `git add -A` staging all changes
- No rollback mechanism for failed operations

## Solution Applied

Replaced the hook with a non-destructive version that:

- Only validates staged files (no working directory modifications)
- Provides clear error messages when validation fails
- Maintains quality checks without corruption risk
- Creates backup of original hook

## Files Affected

- `.git/hooks/pre-push` - Fixed version (non-destructive validation)
- `.git/hooks/pre-push.backup` - Original hook backup
- `.git/hooks/pre-push.fixed` - Template for the fix

## Prevention

The new hook:

1. Checks staged files only using `git show :$file`
2. Never modifies working directory files
3. Provides helpful error messages
4. Maintains all quality validation features

## Testing

The fixed hook has been tested and no longer corrupts files during push operations.
