# Cross-Hub Workflow Discovery with Velocity Protocol Integration

## üåê Overview

This PR implements **decentralized workflow discovery** across Permamind hubs, enabling workflows to discover, learn from, and enhance each other across the entire network while maintaining full **Velocity protocol compliance**.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üîç Cross-Hub Discovery
- **Discover workflows** across all Permamind hubs in the network
- **Find similar workflows** with better performance metrics
- **Search by capability** (e.g., "data-analysis", "content-generation")
- **Filter by requirements** (e.g., "large-datasets", "real-time-processing")
- **Reputation-based ranking** using network-wide quality scoring

### ‚ö° Enhancement Pattern Sharing
- **Request optimization patterns** from high-performing workflows
- **Learn implementation techniques** from successful workflows across hubs
- **Apply compatible enhancements** locally with risk assessment
- **Share improvements back** to benefit the entire ecosystem

### üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Security
- **Granular visibility controls** through tag-based permissions
- **Public workflows** (`ai_tag: ["public"]`) - discoverable by anyone
- **Network workflows** (`ai_tag: ["network"]`) - Permamind users only
- **Private workflows** - hub-local only, not discoverable
- **User ownership** - all data stored permanently on Arweave

### üì° Velocity Protocol Compliance
- **Uses standard `fetchEvents`** - no custom message types
- **Event-based storage** - workflows as AI_MEMORY events (kind "10")
- **Smart tagging system** - rich metadata through workflow-specific tags
- **Efficient filtering** - tag-based discovery at the protocol level

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### New Components Added

#### `CrossHubDiscoveryService.ts`
- Core service for cross-hub workflow discovery
- Hub reputation scoring and network health monitoring
- Enhancement pattern extraction and sharing
- Efficient caching and parallel query optimization

#### MCP Tools Integration
- **`discoverCrossHubWorkflows`** - Find workflows by capability, requirements, or similarity
- **`getNetworkStatistics`** - Network health and ecosystem analytics
- **`requestEnhancementPatterns`** - Learn from high-performing workflows
- **`discoverHubs`** - Hub discovery and reputation analysis

#### Event Structure
```json
{
  "Kind": "10",
  "ai_type": "workflow",
  "workflow_id": "data-processor-v1",
  "workflow_capability": "data-analysis",
  "workflow_requirement": "large-datasets",
  "workflow_performance": "{\"qualityScore\":0.95,\"executionTime\":1200}",
  "workflow_enhancement": "{\"type\":\"optimization\",\"impact\":0.35}",
  "ai_tag": ["public", "discoverable"],
  "ai_importance": "0.8"
}
```

#### Discovery Filter Patterns
```typescript
// Find workflows by capability
const filter = {
  kinds: ["10"],
  tags: {
    ai_type: ["workflow"],
    workflow_capability: ["data-analysis"],
    ai_tag: ["public"]
  }
};

// Request enhancement patterns
const enhancementFilter = {
  kinds: ["10"],
  tags: {
    ai_type: ["enhancement"],
    workflow_id: ["high-performer"],
    ai_tag: ["shareable"]
  }
};
```

// Find workflows similar to your local workflow
const similarWorkflows = await discoveryService.findSimilarWorkflows(
  "my-data-processor", 
  hubId
);

console.log(`Found ${similarWorkflows.length} similar workflows`);
```

### Request Enhancement Patterns
```typescript
// Learn from a high-performing workflow
const patterns = await discoveryService.requestEnhancementPatterns(
  topPerformer.hubId,
  topPerformer.workflowId
);

patterns.forEach(pattern => {
  console.log(`${pattern.type}: ${pattern.description} (${pattern.impact * 100}% improvement)`);
});
```

### Network Statistics
```typescript
// Get ecosystem health metrics
const stats = await discoveryService.getNetworkStatistics();
console.log(`Network Health: ${stats.networkHealthScore * 100}%`);
console.log(`Total Workflows: ${stats.totalPublicWorkflows}`);
```
