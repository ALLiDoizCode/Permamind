# Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for Agent Skills Registry, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
This is a backend-only/CLI project with no traditional frontend interface. The user interface is the command-line terminal (macOS Terminal, Linux shells, Windows PowerShell/CMD).

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A** - This is a greenfield project starting from scratch. The monorepo structure will be manually configured with TypeScript, Node.js tooling, and the specified technology stack (Commander.js, Jest, etc.). No starter templates will be used to maintain full control over project structure and avoid unnecessary dependencies that could slow the 2-week sprint.
