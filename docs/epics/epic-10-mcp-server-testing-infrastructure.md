# Epic 10: MCP Server Testing Infrastructure Enhancement - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Enhance the MCP server testing infrastructure to enable proper CI/CD validation by implementing a test mode transport, creating proper MCP client integration tests, and documenting server design constraints for developer clarity.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

- **Current relevant functionality:** MCP server uses stdio transport exclusively, designed for interactive client connections
- **Technology stack:** FastMCP framework, TypeScript, Node.js 20+, Vitest testing framework
- **Integration points:** Server initialization, tool registration, FastMCP transport layer

### Enhancement Details

- **What's being added/changed:** Adding test mode transport option, creating MCP client-based integration tests, adding comprehensive documentation about server design constraints
- **How it integrates:** New transport mode will be configurable via environment variable, integration tests will use proper MCP client protocol, documentation will be added to README and developer guides
- **Success criteria:** CI/CD pipeline can properly test server functionality, developers understand server limitations, end-to-end testing validates full MCP protocol flow

## Stories

### Story 10.1: Implement Test Mode Transport for MCP Server

**Description:** Create a test-friendly transport mode that doesn't rely on stdio, allowing the server to be tested in CI environments without protocol conflicts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Add TEST_TRANSPORT environment variable support
- Implement HTTP or memory-based transport for test mode
- Server starts successfully in test mode without stdio requirements
- Transport mode is backward compatible (stdio remains default)
- Test mode handles initialization and tool registration properly

### Story 10.2: Create MCP Client Integration Tests

**Description:** Develop comprehensive integration tests using a proper MCP client to validate server functionality end-to-end.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Implement or integrate MCP client library for testing
- Create test suite covering server initialization handshake
- Test all tool categories with proper request/response validation
- Validate error handling and edge cases through client
- Tests run reliably in CI environment

### Story 10.3: Document Server Design Constraints and Testing Strategy

**Description:** Create comprehensive documentation explaining the server's interactive design, testing limitations, and proper usage patterns.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Add "Testing" section to README explaining stdio transport constraints
- Document test mode configuration and usage
- Create developer guide for writing MCP server tests
- Include CI/CD configuration examples
- Document troubleshooting guide for common testing issues

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing stdio transport remains unchanged and default
- [x] Current server initialization flow is preserved
- [x] All existing tools work with both transport modes
- [x] No breaking changes to server API

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Adding complexity to server initialization could introduce bugs
- **Mitigation:** Implement transport selection early in startup, extensive testing of both modes
- **Rollback Plan:** Test mode is optional via environment variable, can be disabled without affecting production

## Definition of Done

- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Existing stdio functionality verified through manual testing
- [x] Test mode works reliably in CI/CD pipeline
- [x] Documentation is clear and comprehensive
- [x] No regression in existing server functionality
- [x] CI/CD pipeline runs integration tests successfully

## Technical Considerations

### Transport Architecture

- Consider using FastMCP's built-in transport abstraction
- HTTP transport might be easiest for testing
- Memory/mock transport could be faster for unit tests

### Testing Framework Integration

- Leverage Vitest's existing infrastructure
- Consider using `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` for client implementation
- Ensure tests are isolated and don't interfere with each other

### CI/CD Configuration

- Update GitHub Actions workflows to use test mode
- Ensure proper environment variable configuration
- Add test result reporting to PR checks

## Dependencies

- FastMCP framework capabilities for custom transports
- MCP client library or SDK for testing
- CI/CD pipeline configuration access

## Success Metrics

- CI/CD pipeline reliability improves to 95%+
- Server testing time reduced by 50%
- Zero false-positive test failures due to transport issues
- Developer onboarding time reduced through better documentation

## Notes

This epic addresses critical testing infrastructure gaps discovered during CI/CD troubleshooting. The current stdio-only transport makes automated testing difficult and causes failures in CI environments. By implementing a proper test mode and client-based testing, we can ensure reliable validation of server functionality while maintaining the interactive design for production use.
