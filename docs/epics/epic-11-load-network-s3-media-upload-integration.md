# Epic 11: Load Network S3 Media Upload Integration Epic - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Overview

**Epic ID:** 11  
**Epic Type:** Brownfield Enhancement  
**Status:** Draft  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Effort:** 3 Stories, ~2-3 weeks  
**Dependencies:** None (purely additive)

## Epic Goal

Integrate Load Network's S3-compatible object storage layer into Permamind to enable users to upload, store, and manage media files (images, documents, and other data) with hybrid permanent/temporal storage capabilities that complement the existing AO and Arweave infrastructure.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

- **Current relevant functionality:** Permamind currently provides immortal memory layer through AO processes and Arweave permanent storage, with 40+ services handling various aspects of decentralized data management
- **Technology stack:** TypeScript, FastMCP framework, AO Connect (@permaweb/aoconnect), Arweave, Node.js 20+
- **Integration points:** Existing AIMemoryService, PermawebDeployService, and AOMessageService infrastructure

### Enhancement Details

- **What's being added/changed:** Adding Load Network S3-compatible storage service that provides temporal object storage with optional promotion to permanent Arweave storage
- **How it integrates:** New LoadNetworkStorageService will extend existing storage patterns used by PermawebDeployService and integrate with AIMemoryService for media-enriched memories
- **Success criteria:** Users can upload media files via MCP tools, store them temporarily or permanently, and reference them in AI memories with metadata tracking

## Technical Architecture

### Load Network S3 Capabilities

Based on documentation analysis from `https://www.llmtxt.xyz/g/loadnetwork/gitbook-sync/8`:

- **Object Storage:** Supports S3-compatible API via `~s3@1.0` HyperBEAM device
- **Temporal Storage:** ANS-104 DataItem compatibility with optional expiry
- **Operations Supported:** Create bucket, put object, get object (with range), delete object, list objects, head object
- **Endpoint:** `https://s3-node-0.load.network/~s3@1.0`
- **Security:** Access key authentication required
- **Integration:** Native Arweave integration for permanent storage promotion

### Service Integration Pattern

The new LoadNetworkStorageService will follow Permamind's established patterns:

```typescript
export class LoadNetworkStorageService {
  private s3Client: S3Client;

  constructor() {
    this.s3Client = new S3Client({
      endpoint: "https://s3-node-0.load.network/~s3@1.0",
      credentials: {
        accessKeyId: process.env.LOAD_NETWORK_ACCESS_KEY || "",
        secretAccessKey: process.env.LOAD_NETWORK_SECRET_KEY || "",
      },
    });
  }

  // Bucket management
  async createBucket(bucketName: string): Promise<Result<string>>;
  async listBuckets(): Promise<Result<string[]>>;

  // Object operations
  async uploadFile(params: UploadParams): Promise<Result<UploadResult>>;
  async downloadFile(params: DownloadParams): Promise<Result<Buffer>>;
  async deleteFile(params: DeleteParams): Promise<Result<void>>;
  async listFiles(params: ListParams): Promise<Result<FileMetadata[]>>;
}
```

## Stories

### Story 11.1: Create LoadNetworkStorageService with S3 SDK Integration

**User Story:** As a Permamind developer, I want a LoadNetworkStorageService that provides S3-compatible storage operations so that the system can handle media file storage with the same reliability patterns as existing storage services.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Add bucket management operations (create, list, delete) with proper error handling and retry logic
- Implement secure access key management through environment variables
- Follow existing TypeScript strict mode and error handling patterns from PermawebDeployService
- Include comprehensive unit tests with mock S3 client for reliable testing
- Add service documentation following existing Permamind service standards

**Technical Tasks:**

- [ ] Install AWS S3 SDK: `npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3`
- [ ] Create `src/services/LoadNetworkStorageService.ts`
- [ ] Implement S3Client configuration with Load Network endpoint

- Implement file size limits and validation following existing MCP tool patterns
- Support both temporal and permanent storage options with clear user feedback
- Follow FastMCP tool registration patterns from existing DocumentationToolFactory
- Add comprehensive tool descriptions for AI understanding and natural language usage

**Technical Tasks:**

- [ ] Install mime-types: `npm install mime-types @types/mime-types`
- [ ] Create MediaToolFactory in `src/tools/media/`
- [ ] Implement UploadMediaCommand with file validation
- [ ] Create ListMediaFilesCommand with filtering capabilities
- [ ] Add GetMediaFileCommand for file retrieval
- [ ] Add Zod schemas for all media tool parameters
- [ ] Implement file type validation and size limits
- [ ] Register MediaToolFactory in server.ts
- [ ] Write integration tests for all media tools
- [ ] Add tool documentation and examples

### Story 11.3: Integrate Media Storage with AI Memory System

**User Story:** As a Permamind user, I want to reference media files in my AI memories so that I can create rich, multimedia memories that combine text content with images, documents, and other data files.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Extend AIMemoryService to support media file references in memory content and metadata
- Add media metadata fields to memory context tracking (file type, size, storage location, permanent/temporal status)
- Implement hybrid storage workflow allowing users to promote temporal files to permanent Arweave storage
- Create media-enriched memory templates that include file references and descriptions
- Support media file validation and integrity checking for referenced files
- Enable memory search by media type and file metadata
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing memory operations and data structures
- Add integration tests verifying media-memory workflows with existing aiMemoryService patterns

**Technical Tasks:**

- [ ] Extend AIMemory interface to include mediaReferences field
- [ ] Update AIMemoryService to handle media metadata
- [ ] Implement media reference validation in memory storage
- [ ] Add media file promotion workflow (temporal → permanent)
- [ ] Create media-enriched memory search capabilities
- [ ] Update memory templates to support media references
- [ ] Implement media file integrity checking
- [ ] Write integration tests for media-memory workflows
- [ ] Update existing memory tests to ensure backward compatibility

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] **Existing APIs remain unchanged** - LoadNetworkStorageService is additive
- [x] **Database schema changes are backward compatible** - Only extending memory metadata
- [x] **UI changes follow existing patterns** - New MCP tools follow FastMCP conventions
- [x] **Performance impact is minimal** - Async operations with proper error boundaries

## Risk Assessment

### Primary Risk

External dependency on Load Network S3 service availability affecting core Permamind functionality

### Mitigation Strategy

- Service will gracefully degrade with fallback error messages
- Media upload is optional functionality that doesn't break existing features
- Comprehensive error handling with clear user feedback
- Service can be disabled via feature flag if needed

### Rollback Plan

- New service can be disabled via feature flag
- Existing functionality remains unaffected as this is purely additive
- Media references in memories will gracefully handle missing files

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- LoadNetworkStorageService with mocked S3Client
- Media tool commands with parameter validation
- AIMemoryService media integration logic

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end media upload → storage → memory reference → retrieval workflow
- Load Network S3 service integration (if test credentials available)
- Media file validation and error handling scenarios
