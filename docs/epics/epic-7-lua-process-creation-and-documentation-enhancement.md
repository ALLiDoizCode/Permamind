# Epic 7: Lua Process Creation and Documentation Enhancement Epic

## Epic Goal

Enable AI agents using the Permamind MCP server to seamlessly create and deploy functional Lua processes for AO by implementing intelligent workflow integration between existing comprehensive AO/Lua documentation and process creation tools, providing guided Lua code generation and deployment workflows.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

- Current functionality: queryPermawebDocs provides comprehensive AO/Lua knowledge (90 documents, 36,805 words) including handler patterns, process architecture, and Lua tutorials; createProcess and evalProcess tools handle process spawning and code evaluation; but AI agents lack integrated workflows connecting documentation knowledge to practical Lua code generation and deployment
- Technology stack: FastMCP + TypeScript + AO Connect + existing ProcessToolFactory + comprehensive AO documentation system
- Integration points: queryPermawebDocs tool with extensive AO knowledge base, createProcess/evalProcess tools, ProcessToolFactory infrastructure

### Enhancement Details

- What's being added/changed: Intelligent workflow integration that connects queryPermawebDocs knowledge to createProcess/evalProcess workflows, enabling AI agents to automatically query relevant documentation, generate appropriate Lua code based on user requirements, create processes, and deploy functional handlers using existing tools
- How it integrates: Creates workflow orchestration between existing tools without duplicating knowledge, adds Lua code generation capabilities informed by documentation patterns, enhances createProcess with template-guided workflows
- Success criteria: AI agents can understand user requirements, query relevant AO documentation automatically, generate proper Lua processes with handlers and message routing, and deploy functional AO applications through seamless tool integration

## Stories

### Story 7.1: Create Intelligent Documentation-to-Code Workflow Integration

**User Story:** As an AI agent using Permamind, I want to automatically connect user requirements to relevant AO documentation and then generate appropriate Lua code, so that I can create functional processes without manual documentation lookup.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Create workflow orchestration that automatically queries queryPermawebDocs based on user requirements (e.g., "token contract" → queries token-related AO docs)
- Implement requirement analysis that maps user descriptions to relevant documentation domains and patterns
- Develop Lua code generation templates informed by documentation examples (handlers, message routing, state management)
- Enable automatic documentation reference lookup during code generation for best practices
- Integrate code explanation that references specific documentation sources used
- Ensure generated code follows patterns found in comprehensive AO documentation (90 documents, 36,805 words)

### Story 7.2: Implement Guided Lua Process Creation and Deployment Workflow

**User Story:** As a user working with an AI agent, I want to describe what kind of AO process I need in natural language and have the system automatically generate, deploy, and test the appropriate Lua implementation using existing tools.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Integrate createProcess tool with documentation-informed Lua generation from Story 7.1
- Implement end-to-end workflow: requirement analysis → documentation query → code generation → process creation → code evaluation → testing
- Generate proper Lua process structure with handlers following AO documentation patterns (Handlers.add with name, match, handle functions)
- Provide process templates for common use cases informed by existing AO tutorials (tokens, chatrooms, bots, games)
- Include automatic validation using evalProcess to test generated handlers before final deployment
- Enable iterative refinement: test → analyze results → query additional documentation → refine code → re-test
- Support deployment verification through message testing and state inspection

### Story 7.3: Create Process Architecture Decision Support System

**User Story:** As an AI agent creating AO processes, I want to automatically recommend optimal process architectures by analyzing user requirements against AO documentation patterns, so that I can suggest appropriate handler designs, state management, and message routing strategies.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Implement architectural pattern analysis using existing AO documentation (process examples from 90 documents)
- Create decision logic that maps user requirements to documented architecture patterns (stateless vs stateful, single vs multi-process)
- Provide handler pattern recommendations based on documented message types and workflow examples
- Include state management guidance derived from AO tutorials and process examples
- Suggest error handling patterns found in existing AO documentation and best practices
- Enable architecture validation by querying documentation for similar implemented patterns
- Support architecture explanation with references to specific documentation sources and examples

### Story 7.4: Implement Seamless Tool Integration for Complete Process Development

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI agent to seamlessly orchestrate all available tools (documentation queries, process creation, code evaluation) so that describing my process needs results in a functional, tested, and deployed AO process.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Create workflow orchestration that seamlessly connects queryPermawebDocs → createProcess → evalProcess → testing
- Enable automatic tool selection based on workflow stage (documentation lookup → code generation → process spawning → code deployment)
- Implement state management across tools to maintain context throughout the process creation workflow
- Support both guided creation (step-by-step with user feedback) and autonomous creation (fully automated from requirements)
- Provide comprehensive process creation reporting that includes documentation sources used, code generated, processes created, and test results
- Enable workflow resumption and iterative improvement (modify requirements → re-query docs → regenerate code → re-deploy)
- Support workflow templates for common process types that leverage documented AO patterns
