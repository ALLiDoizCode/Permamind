# Implementation Priorities

## Phase 1: Foundation (MVP Refactoring)

1. Simplify memory tools to core store/search functions
2. Remove system tools and streamline process tools
3. Reduce token tools to essential operations
4. Preserve contact and documentation capabilities

## Phase 2: NLS Enhancement (Token Tools Migration)

1. Create general executeAction NLS tool
2. Embed token blueprints directly in server
3. Implement missing saveTokenMapping functionality
4. Ensure immediate NLS availability

## Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities (BMAD Integration)

1. Create @init tool for BMAD installation
2. Implement Claude Code slash command integration for all BMAD resources
3. Add auto-detection and documentation system
4. Enable complete BMAD methodology access through clean slash commands

## Phase 4: Revolutionary UX (Agent Enhancement)

1. ~~Implement dual-platform agent detection and activation~~ (Story 4.1 deprecated)
2. Create file-based agent systems for Claude Code (Story 4.2)
3. Build unified memory-driven context sharing architecture (Story 4.3)
4. Enable natural AI team collaboration experiences

## Phase 5: AO Process Infrastructure (Process Management Tools)

1. Implement createProcess MCP tool for AO process spawning
2. Add evalProcess MCP tool for Lua code evaluation
3. Integrate with existing ProcessToolFactory and infrastructure
4. Enable complete AO development lifecycle management
