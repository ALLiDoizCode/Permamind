# Risk Mitigation Strategy

## Cross-Epic Compatibility

- **Risk:** Conflicting changes between epic implementations
- **Mitigation:** Sequential implementation with thorough integration testing
- **Dependencies:** MVP Refactoring must complete before Token NLS Migration and BMAD Integration

## System Integrity

- **Risk:** Breaking existing functionality during consolidation
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive test coverage, feature flags, rollback plans
- **Validation:** Each epic includes regression testing requirements

## Performance Impact

- **Risk:** Resource loading affecting system performance
- **Mitigation:** Lazy loading patterns, on-demand resource access, minimal startup impact
- **Monitoring:** Performance benchmarks for each implementation phase
