# Permamind + BMad Integration Implementation Plan

**Generated:** August 15, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation  
**Goal:** Create a comprehensive Permaweb development platform through BMad METHOD integration with Permamind MCP server

## Executive Summary

Transform Permamind from a memory layer tool into a complete Permaweb development platform by integrating the BMad METHOD as an expansion pack. This creates a trusted agentic development environment for building and deploying Permaweb applications from concept to production.

### Key Innovation

**Architectural Intelligence + Agentic Development** - Not just code generation, but teaching WHY certain patterns work better in AO's actor model vs other blockchain architectures.

## Phase 1: Core BMad Integration (MVP)

### Objective

Get basic BMad workflows executing through Permamind MCP server with file-based document generation and minimal context usage.

### Implementation Tasks

#### 1.1 MCP Tool Integration

**New Tools to Add:**

```typescript
// Core BMad workflow execution
{
  name: "executeBmadWorkflow",
  description: "Execute complete BMad development workflows",
  parameters: {
    workflow: "permaweb-fullstack | greenfield-fullstack | brownfield-fullstack",
    projectContext: string,
    startingAgent?: string
  }
}

// Individual agent invocation
{
  name: "invokeAgent",
  description: "Invoke specific BMad agent with file I/O",
  parameters: {
    agent: "analyst | pm | architect | dev | qa | po | sm",
    inputFiles: string[],
    task: string,
    context: string
  }
}

// Task execution
{
  name: "executeTask",
  description: "Execute specific BMad task",
  parameters: {
    task: string,
    inputData: any,
    outputPath?: string
  }
}
```

#### 1.2 Agent Definition Enhancement

**Enhance existing BMad agents with Permamind tool awareness:**

**Key Changes:**

- Add `tools_awareness` section to each agent
- Document available Permamind MCP tools
- Update workflows to use MCP tools directly
- Preserve file-based I/O for context efficiency

#### 1.3 Workflow File Creation

**Create Permaweb-specific workflow:**

```
.bmad-core/workflows/permaweb-fullstack.yaml
```

**Extends greenfield-fullstack.yaml with:**

- Permaweb-specific project types
- AO process development steps
- aolite testing integration
- Process deployment via Permamind tools

#### 1.4 Natural Language Request Routing

**Implement flexible request matching:**

- "implement story 1.1" → dev agent, develop-story task
- "validate story 1.1" → qa agent, review-story task
- "review architecture" → architect agent, review task

### Success Criteria Phase 1

- [ ] Can execute `executeBmadWorkflow` for basic project planning
- [ ] Generates actual files in docs/ folder (not context)
- [ ] Agent handoffs work with minimal context
- [ ] Natural language routing works for common requests
