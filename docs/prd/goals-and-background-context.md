# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Launch MVP within 2 weeks with functional CLI capabilities (publish, install, search) by October 27, 2025
- Achieve >95% installation success rate to establish trust and reliability as core value proposition
- Bootstrap ecosystem with 5+ high-quality skills (AO, Arweave, related topics) to demonstrate value and set quality standards
- Establish first-mover positioning as the recognized standard platform for agent skills distribution
- Drive initial community adoption: 50+ CLI installs and 10+ community-published skills within 30 days post-launch
- Validate architectural advantage of free consumption model (browse/search/install free, publish/review/rate paid)
- Enable complete ecosystem loop: developers can search → install → publish skills without friction

## Background Context

The Claude agent skills feature launched approximately one week ago, introducing modular, reusable expertise packages that extend Claude's capabilities. However, the ecosystem currently lacks centralized discovery and distribution mechanisms, forcing developers to share skills through fragmented channels like GitHub repositories and Discord attachments. This creates significant friction in discovery, installation reliability issues, and prevents ecosystem-wide skill reuse.

Agent Skills Registry addresses this fragmentation by providing a decentralized, npm-like package manager leveraging Arweave for permanent storage and AO processes for the decentralized registry. The platform enables developers to publish, search, and install skills through familiar CLI commands, dramatically reducing friction from discovery to deployment. With the ecosystem in its formation phase, launching within 2 weeks captures critical first-mover advantage and establishes the de facto standard before competing solutions emerge or community conventions fragment.
