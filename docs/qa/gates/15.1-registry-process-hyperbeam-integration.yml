# Quality Gate: 15.1 - Registry Process HyperBEAM Integration
schema: 1
story: "15.1"
story_title: "Registry Process HyperBEAM Integration"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Implementation excellent (100% test pass rate, zero regressions, perfect AO compliance), but HTTP endpoint validation blocked by infrastructure funding/connectivity issues. Core functionality complete and production-ready for message-based access."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No authentication changes, owner validation preserved, input validation comprehensive, no new attack surface. HTTP endpoints trust HyperBEAM infrastructure security (acceptable)."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Code-level performance excellent (non-blocking Patch calls, efficient JSON encoding). HTTP endpoint performance untested due to infrastructure issues (not a code concern)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Error handling robust (Patch failures don't break handlers), backward compatibility perfect (100% test pass rate), recovery mechanisms sound (idempotent state exposure)."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Code clarity excellent, comprehensive documentation (IMPLEMENTATION.md), zero technical debt introduced, troubleshooting guide provided."
