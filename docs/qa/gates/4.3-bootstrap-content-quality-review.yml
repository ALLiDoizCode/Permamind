nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Wallet security prominently featured (arweave skill: 6 critical rules). AO process security emphasized (monolithic design). No sensitive data exposure. Security best practices included in both skills."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Skills optimally sized for progressive loading (ao: ~4,950 tokens, arweave: ~4,730 tokens). Within Agent Skills 3-5k token best practice range. Gateway failover strategies documented."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Error handling patterns demonstrated. Retry logic and failover strategies documented. AO network propagation delays documented as expected behavior. Timeout handling included."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clear documentation structure. All technical claims referenced to architecture sources. Version metadata included. Comprehensive quality review artifacts for future reference. Skills serve as ecosystem reference implementations."

recommendations:
  immediate: []  # No blocking issues identified
  future:
    - action: "Update project documentation (README, troubleshooting) with bootstrap skill examples"
      refs: ["README.md", "docs/troubleshooting.md"]
      rationale: "AC 8 - identified documentation updates to showcase bootstrap content"
    - action: "Monitor community feedback for potential v1.1.0 improvements"
      refs: ["skills/ao/SKILL.md", "skills/arweave/SKILL.md"]
      rationale: "Continuous improvement based on ecosystem usage patterns"

justification: |
  Story 4.3 successfully validated both bootstrap skills (ao, arweave) as exceptional quality
  reference implementations for the ecosystem. Comprehensive quality review produced thorough
  documentation artifacts (checklist + report) demonstrating systematic validation against all
  acceptance criteria. 98% quality score exceeds Epic 4's 95% "exceptional quality" threshold.
  Zero technical inaccuracies, zero errors, 100% standards compliance. Both skills production-ready
  and serving as ecosystem standards. No blocking issues identified. Story ready for Done status.
