  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No sensitive data exposure, proper error boundaries, SDK isolation, debug-only logging"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "2-second timeout, caching prevents redundant calls, non-blocking async, minimal bundle impact"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Graceful degradation, UI never breaks, proper error handling, fallback always available"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation of concerns, well-documented, TypeScript strict mode, testable architecture"

# Detailed recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []  # No blocking issues
  future:
    - action: "Consider persistent caching (localStorage) for better UX across page reloads"
      refs: ["frontend/src/lib/arns-resolver.ts:3-4"]
      rationale: "Session-based cache is lost on page reload, localStorage would improve performance"
    - action: "Consider AbortController pattern for more robust cancellation in future iteration"
      refs: ["frontend/src/lib/arns-resolver.ts:36-48"]
      rationale: "AbortController provides more control than Promise.race timeout pattern"
