# Implementation highlights achieving PASS status
achievements:
  - "Successfully unified executeAction and sendMessage tool functionality"
  - "Implemented intelligent ADP-based handler discovery with fallback mechanisms"
  - "Added comprehensive mode detection (auto, read, write, validate)"
  - "Created backward-compatible migration path with deprecation warnings"
  - "Enhanced error handling with contextual guidance and parameter suggestions"
  - "Achieved 100% test coverage for new unified tool implementation"
  - "Maintained strict TypeScript compliance with zero 'any' usage"
  - "Integrated seamlessly with existing ProcessToolFactory architecture"
