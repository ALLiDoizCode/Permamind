# Story 1.1: Simplify Memory Tools to Core Functions

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** developer implementing MVP functionality,
**I want** to simplify memory tools to only essential storeMemory and searchMemory functions,
**so that** the tool architecture is focused and maintainable while preserving core AI memory capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Remove complex memory tools: AddMemoriesBatchCommand, AddMemoryEnhancedCommand, AddReasoningChainCommand, GetAllMemoriesCommand, GetAllMemoriesForConversationCommand, GetMemoryAnalyticsCommand, LinkMemoriesCommand, SearchMemoriesAdvancedCommand
2. Keep only: AddMemoryCommand (renamed to storeMemory), SearchMemoriesCommand (renamed to searchMemory)
3. Update MemoryToolFactory to register only the 2 essential tools
4. Preserve underlying aiMemoryService functionality
5. Update tool descriptions to focus on MVP use cases

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

This is the first story in the epic, so no previous story context available.

### Data Models

**Memory Data Structure** [Source: src/tools/memory/commands/AddMemoryCommand.ts#L7-L11]:

```typescript
interface AddMemoryArgs {
  content: string;
  p: string; // Public key of other party
  role: string; // Role of author
}
```

**Tag Structure for Memory Storage** [Source: src/tools/memory/commands/AddMemoryCommand.ts#L33-L49]:

- Kind tag with value "10" for memory type identification
- Content tag containing the actual memory content
- Role tag ("r") for author role
- Party tag ("p") for public key reference

### API Specifications

**HubService Integration** [Source: src/tools/memory/commands/AddMemoryCommand.ts#L52-L56]:

- Uses `hubService.createEvent(keyPair, hubId, tags)` for memory storage
- Uses `hubService.search(hubId, search, "10")` for memory retrieval [Source: src/tools/memory/commands/SearchMemoriesCommand.ts#L33-L37]

**Tool Context Structure** [Source: src/tools/memory/commands/AddMemoryCommand.ts#L28]:

```typescript
interface ToolContext {
  keyPair: JWKInterface;
  hubId: string;
  publicKey: string;
}
```

### Component Specifications

**ToolCommand Base Class Pattern** [Source: src/tools/memory/commands/AddMemoryCommand.ts#L13]:

- Extends `ToolCommand<ArgsType, ReturnType>`
- Must implement `metadata: ToolMetadata` property
- Must implement `parametersSchema` with Zod validation
- Must implement `execute(args: ArgsType): Promise<ReturnType>` method

**Tool Metadata Structure** [Source: src/tools/memory/commands/AddMemoryCommand.ts#L14-L20]:

```typescript
interface ToolMetadata {
  description: string;
  name: string; // This will change to "storeMemory" and "searchMemory"
  openWorldHint: boolean;
  readOnlyHint: boolean;
  title: string;
}
```

### File Locations

**Memory Tool Files** [Source: Current file structure]:

- Tool Factory: `src/tools/memory/MemoryToolFactory.ts`
- Commands Directory: `src/tools/memory/commands/`
- Commands Index: `src/tools/memory/commands/index.ts`
- Main Index: `src/tools/memory/index.ts`

**Service Dependencies**:

- Hub Service: `src/services/HubService.ts`
- AI Memory Service: `src/services/aiMemoryService.ts`

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Framework** [Source: package.json#L110]:

- Uses Vitest for testing framework
- Coverage reports with @vitest/coverage-v8
- Current test scripts are placeholders - need to implement actual tests

**Test File Structure** [Source: Epic Story 4 requirements]:

- Unit tests should go in `tests/unit/tools/memory/`
- Need to test storeMemory and searchMemory functionality
- Target 90% test coverage for memory tools

### Technical Constraints

**Dependencies** [Source: src/tools/memory/commands/AddMemoryCommand.ts#L1-L5]:

- Must use Zod for parameter validation
- Must maintain compatibility with existing Tag model
- Must preserve hubService integration patterns
- Tool commands must follow FastMCP tool registration patterns

**Error Handling Pattern** [Source: src/tools/memory/commands/AddMemoryCommand.ts#L58-L62]:

```typescript
try {
  // Operation logic
} catch (error) {
  throw new Error(
    `Failed to [operation]: ${error instanceof Error ? error.message : "Unknown error"}`,
  );
}
```

### Project Structure Notes

The current project structure aligns well with the epic requirements. The tool factory pattern is established and the memory tools are properly separated from other tool categories. The service layer abstraction allows for preserving underlying functionality while simplifying the tool interface.

## Testing

### Testing Standards

**Test Framework**: Vitest with TypeScript support
**Test Location**: `tests/unit/tools/memory/`
**Coverage Target**: 90% test coverage for memory tools
**Test Pattern**: Mock external dependencies (hubService), test tool execution and error handling

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-17

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent implementation!** The developer successfully achieved all acceptance criteria while maintaining clean, maintainable code architecture. The original implementation was solid, but I identified several opportunities for improvement as a senior developer and implemented strategic refactoring to enhance code quality and maintainability.

### Refactoring Performed

As a senior developer, I made the following improvements to elevate the code quality:

- **File**: `src/tools/memory/constants.ts`
  - **Change**: Created centralized constants file with MEMORY_KIND and MEMORY_TAGS
  - **Why**: Eliminates magic numbers and string literals scattered throughout the codebase
  - **How**: Improves maintainability and reduces chance of errors when memory system evolves

- **File**: `src/tools/memory/utils.ts`
  - **Change**: Created `createMemoryTags` utility function
  - **Why**: Removes code duplication and centralizes tag creation logic
  - **How**: Makes tag creation consistent and easier to modify in future

- **File**: `src/tools/memory/commands/AddMemoryCommand.ts`
  - **Change**: Refactored to use constants and utility functions
  - **Why**: Reduces code duplication and improves readability
  - **How**: Cleaner, more maintainable code with better separation of concerns

- **File**: `src/tools/memory/commands/SearchMemoriesCommand.ts`
  - **Change**: Updated to use MEMORY_KIND constant
  - **Why**: Consistency with other memory components
  - **How**: Single source of truth for memory kind identifier

- **File**: `tests/helpers/memory-test-helpers.ts`
  - **Change**: Added comprehensive test helper utilities
  - **Why**: Improves test maintainability and reduces test code duplication
  - **How**: Centralized test setup and assertion helpers

- **File**: `tests/unit/tools/memory/utils.unit.test.ts`
  - **Change**: Added unit tests for utility functions
  - **Why**: Ensures utility functions are thoroughly tested
  - **How**: Increases test coverage and confidence in refactored code

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ All code follows TypeScript best practices with proper typing
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Files organized correctly following established patterns
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests with 100% pass rate (13 tests)

### Security Review

**No security concerns identified.** The implementation properly:

- Uses Zod for input validation
- Maintains proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Follows secure coding practices for external service integration
- No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data

### Performance Considerations

**Performance is optimal for MVP scope:**

- Efficient tag creation with minimal object allocation
- Proper async/await usage for service calls
- JSON serialization handled appropriately
