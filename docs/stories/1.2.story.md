# Story 1.2: Remove System Tools and Streamline Process Tools

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** developer implementing MVP functionality,
**I want** to remove System tools entirely and streamline Process tools to essential AO communication functions,
**so that** the tool architecture is focused on core natural language process interaction while maintaining AO process communication capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Remove entire SystemToolFactory and related commands
2. In ProcessToolFactory, keep only: ExecuteProcessActionCommand (for talkToProcess functionality), QueryAOProcessMessagesCommand
3. Remove: ExecuteGraphQLQueryCommand, ExecuteSmartProcessActionCommand, GetTransactionDetailsCommand, QueryArweaveTransactionsCommand, QueryBlockInfoCommand
4. Update process tool descriptions to focus on natural language process interaction

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.1 completion:

- Successfully simplified memory tools to core functions (storeMemory, searchMemory)
- Established pattern for tool factory registration updates
- Created comprehensive unit tests with 100% pass rate
- Verified service layer integrity preservation approach works well
- Learned importance of maintaining backward compatibility with existing service integrations

### Data Models

**AO Process Message Structure** [Source: src/tools/process/commands/QueryAOProcessMessagesCommand.ts#L7-L20]:

```typescript
interface QueryAOProcessMessagesArgs {
  action?: string;
  after?: string;
  before?: string;
  first?: number;
  fromProcessId?: string;
  last?: number;
  msgRefs?: string[];
  processId?: string;
  reference?: string;
  sort?: SortOrder;
  sortOrder?: SortOrder;
  toProcessId?: string;
}
```

**Process Action Structure** [Source: src/tools/process/commands/ExecuteProcessActionCommand.ts#L11-L15]:

```typescript
interface ExecuteProcessActionArgs {
  processId: string;
  processMarkdown: string;
  request: string;
}
```

### API Specifications

**ProcessCommunicationService Integration** [Source: src/tools/process/commands/ExecuteProcessActionCommand.ts#L54-L59]:

- Uses `processCommunicationService.executeProcessRequest(processMarkdown, processId, request, keyPair)` for natural language process interaction
- Returns JSON stringified result with automatic error handling

**ArweaveGraphQLService Integration** [Source: src/tools/process/commands/QueryAOProcessMessagesCommand.ts#L133]:

- Uses `arweaveGraphQLService.queryAOProcessMessages(query)` for AO process message queries
- Returns structured result with count, pageInfo, and transactions

**Tool Context Structure** [Source: src/tools/process/commands/ExecuteProcessActionCommand.ts#L48]:

```typescript
interface ToolContext {
  keyPair: JWKInterface;
  hubId: string;
  publicKey: string;
}
```

### Component Specifications

**ToolCommand Base Class Pattern** [Source: src/tools/process/commands/ExecuteProcessActionCommand.ts#L17-L20]:

- Extends `ToolCommand<ArgsType, ReturnType>`
- Must implement `metadata: ToolMetadata` property
- Must implement `parametersSchema` with Zod validation
- Must implement `execute(args: ArgsType): Promise<ReturnType>` method

**Tool Metadata Structure** [Source: src/tools/process/commands/ExecuteProcessActionCommand.ts#L21-L32]:

```typescript
interface ToolMetadata {
  description: string;
  name: string; // "executeProcessAction" and "queryAOProcessMessages"
  openWorldHint: boolean;
  readOnlyHint: boolean; // false for executeProcessAction, true for queryAOProcessMessages
  title: string;
}
```

### File Locations

**Process Tool Files** [Source: Current file structure]:

- Tool Factory: `src/tools/process/ProcessToolFactory.ts`
- Commands Directory: `src/tools/process/commands/`
- Commands Index: `src/tools/process/commands/index.ts`
- Main Index: `src/tools/process/index.ts`

**System Tool Files to Remove** [Source: Current file structure]:

- Tool Factory: `src/tools/system/SystemToolFactory.ts`
- Commands Directory: `src/tools/system/commands/` (empty)
- Commands Index: `src/tools/system/commands/index.ts` (empty)
- Main Index: `src/tools/system/index.ts`

**Server Registration** [Source: src/server.ts#L139-L145, #L211-L217]:

- SystemToolFactory registration occurs in two places in server.ts
- Both setupToolRegistry() and registerBasicTools() functions

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Framework** [Source: Story 1.1 testing approach]:

- Uses Vitest for testing framework
- Coverage reports with @vitest/coverage-v8
- Test structure follows `tests/unit/tools/process/` pattern
- Target 90% test coverage for remaining process tools

**Test File Structure** [Source: Epic Story 4 requirements]:

- Unit tests should go in `tests/unit/tools/process/`
- Need to test executeProcessAction (talkToProcess) and queryAOProcessMessages functionality
- Should follow established testing patterns from Story 1.1

### Technical Constraints

**Dependencies** [Source: src/tools/process/commands/ExecuteProcessActionCommand.ts#L1-L9]:

- Must use Zod for parameter validation
- Must maintain compatibility with existing processCommunicationService
- Must preserve arweaveGraphQLService integration patterns
- Tool commands must follow FastMCP tool registration patterns

**Service Layer Dependencies** [Source: Analysis of tool commands]:

- ProcessCommunicationService for natural language process interaction
- ArweaveGraphQLService for AO process message queries
- Both services must remain functional after tool simplification

**Error Handling Pattern** [Source: src/tools/process/commands/ExecuteProcessActionCommand.ts#L52-L64]:

```typescript
try {
  const result = await serviceCall();
  return JSON.stringify(result);
} catch (error) {
  return `Error: ${error}`;
}
```

### Project Structure Notes

The current project structure aligns well with the epic requirements. The process tool factory pattern is established and follows the same structure as memory tools. The service layer abstraction allows for preserving underlying functionality while simplifying the tool interface. The system tools are already minimal (empty commands directory) making removal straightforward.

**Server Registration Pattern** [Source: src/server.ts#L80-L146]:

- Tools are registered in two locations: setupToolRegistry() and registerBasicTools()
- Both functions need SystemToolFactory registration removal
- ProcessToolFactory registration will remain but with simplified tool set

## Testing

### Testing Standards

**Test Framework**: Vitest with TypeScript support
**Test Location**: `tests/unit/tools/process/`
**Coverage Target**: 90% test coverage for remaining process tools
**Test Pattern**: Mock external dependencies (processCommunicationService, arweaveGraphQLService), test tool execution and error handling

### Test Cases Required

**ExecuteProcessActionCommand Tests**:

- Natural language process interaction with valid inputs
- Error handling for invalid process IDs
- Proper keyPair usage in service calls
- JSON response formatting

**QueryAOProcessMessagesCommand Tests**:

- AO process message queries with various filter parameters
- Pagination handling (first, last, after, before)
- Error handling for GraphQL service failures
- Result formatting and structure validation
