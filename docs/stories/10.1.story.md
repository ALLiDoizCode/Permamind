## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 9.6 (Enhanced ADP Compliance Validation):

- Last story focused on comprehensive validation framework with parameter checking
- Implemented regex-based parsing improvements and validation rule templates
- Achieved 90% implementation quality with extensive test coverage
- Used sophisticated validation patterns with cross-reference checking
- Fixed integration test issues and GitHub Actions workflow improvements

### Architecture Context

**Server Implementation** [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

Current server architecture uses FastMCP framework with stdio transport:

- **FastMCP 1.27+**: TypeScript MCP server framework [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Current Transport**: Exclusively stdio transport (`server.start({ transportType: "stdio" })`) [Source: src/server.ts:204-205]
- **Initialization Flow**: Background initialization with graceful startup patterns [Source: src/server.ts:182-217]
- **Tool Registration**: Two-phase registration (basic + enhanced) with proper context management [Source: src/server.ts:187-200]

**Technology Stack** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

Project technology requirements:

- **TypeScript 5.8+**: Primary language with strict typing
- **FastMCP 1.27+**: TypeScript MCP server framework
- **Node.js 20+**: Runtime environment
- **Vitest 3.1+**: Testing framework with coverage

### Technical Implementation Details

**Server Architecture** [Source: src/server.ts:176-217]

Current server implementation pattern:

```typescript
const server = new FastMCP({
  name: "Permamind Memory Server",
  version: "1.0.0",
});

// Current stdio-only startup
server.start({
  transportType: "stdio",
});
```

**Tool Registration Pattern** [Source: src/server.ts:182-200]

Established tool registration follows factory patterns:

- MemoryToolFactory, ContactToolFactory, ProcessToolFactory, etc.
- Two-phase initialization: `setupToolRegistry()` then tool registration
- Context injection with keyPair, hubId, embeddedTemplates, publicKey
- Error handling with graceful fallback for initialization failures

**Environment Configuration** [Source: src/server.ts:4]

Current environment setup with MCP compatibility considerations:

- Silent dotenv configuration to avoid console output conflicts
- Console suppression during initialization for MCP protocol compatibility
- Environment variable loading patterns established

### File Locations

**Primary Files** [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

- `src/server.ts`: Main MCP server implementation requiring transport mode enhancement
- `src/constants.ts`: Configuration constants for environment variable management
- `tests/unit/`: Unit test directory following `.unit.test.ts` naming convention [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- `tests/integration/`: Integration test directory following `.integration.test.ts` naming convention [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**New Files to Create**

- `tests/unit/server-transport.unit.test.ts`: Unit tests for transport selection logic
- `tests/integration/server-test-mode.integration.test.ts`: Integration tests for test transport mode

**Integration Points**

- FastMCP framework transport configuration (requires research)
- Environment variable management system
- Tool registration and context injection patterns
- Server initialization and startup flow

### Testing Requirements

**Research Required**

- FastMCP framework transport capabilities need investigation before implementation
- HTTP transport implementation may require FastMCP version compatibility verification
- MCP protocol compliance requirements for alternative transports need confirmation

**Testing Standards** [Source: CLAUDE.md#testing-strategy]

Using Vitest framework with comprehensive coverage:

- **Unit Tests**: Individual service and model testing
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-service functionality
- **Coverage Targets**: 90% functions, 85% lines, 75% branches

**Testing Patterns** [Source: CLAUDE.md#testing-strategy]

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach, vi } from "vitest";

// Mock external dependencies
vi.mock("../../../src/relay.js", () => ({
  event: vi.fn(),
  fetchEvents: vi.fn(),
}));

describe("ServiceName", () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    vi.clearAllMocks();
  });

  it("should handle normal operation", async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

**Test Implementation Requirements**

- Test transport selection logic with different environment configurations
- Mock FastMCP framework for transport mode testing
- Test server initialization flow in both stdio and alternative modes
- Verify tool registration works correctly with both transports
- End-to-end server startup testing with alternative transport
- Tool functionality validation in test mode
- MCP protocol compatibility testing with alternative transport
- CI/CD environment simulation and validation

### Technical Constraints

**FastMCP Framework Limitations**

- **CRITICAL**: Transport abstraction capabilities need research verification
- HTTP transport implementation may require FastMCP version compatibility
- MCP protocol compliance requirements for alternative transports
- **BLOCKER**: Implementation cannot proceed until FastMCP capabilities are confirmed

**MCP Protocol Compatibility**

- Maintain full MCP message protocol support regardless of transport
- Ensure alternative transport doesn't break MCP client compatibility
- Preserve existing tool functionality and response formats

**Coding Standards Compliance** [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **TypeScript**: Full strict mode enabled, explicit typing preferred
- **ES Modules**: Use ES modules with `.js` extensions for local imports
- **File Naming**: Services use PascalCase with Service suffix
- **Tests**: Use `.unit.test.ts` or `.integration.test.ts` suffix
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with meaningful error messages

### Security Considerations

- HTTP transport security implications for test environments
- Local-only HTTP server configuration to avoid external exposure
- Test mode should not compromise production security patterns
- Environment variable validation for transport mode selection

## Testing

### Review Date: 2025-08-19

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates excellent engineering practices with clean architecture, proper separation of concerns, and comprehensive error handling. The transport configuration logic is well-isolated in `constants.ts`, and the server startup flow uses appropriate abstraction patterns. The solution maintains backward compatibility while providing the requested test mode functionality.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `src/server.ts:218-247`
  - **Change**: Enhanced endpoint path validation to ensure FastMCP compatibility
  - **Why**: Prevents runtime errors from malformed endpoint paths and improves robustness
  - **How**: Added automatic "/" prefix normalization for endpoints that don't start with "/"

- **File**: `tests/unit/server-transport.unit.test.ts:153-162`
  - **Change**: Added test case for endpoint path normalization
  - **Why**: Ensures the endpoint validation enhancement is properly tested
  - **How**: Added test that verifies config returns endpoint as-is while server handles normalization

### Compliance Check
