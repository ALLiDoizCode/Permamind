## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 10.1 (Implement Test Mode Transport for MCP Server):

- FastMCP 1.27.3 supports 3 transport types: stdio (default), sse (Server-Sent Events), and httpStream (HTTP Stream)
- TEST_TRANSPORT, TEST_TRANSPORT_PORT, and TEST_TRANSPORT_ENDPOINT environment variables implemented
- Server startup modified to support transport configuration with backward compatibility
- Integration test infrastructure exists at `tests/integration/server-test-mode.integration.test.ts`
- Transport selection logic successfully implemented in `src/constants.ts` and `src/server.ts`
- Quality assurance confirmed proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Architecture Context

**Technology Stack** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

Current project technology requirements:

- **TypeScript 5.8+**: Primary language with strict typing
- **FastMCP 1.27+**: TypeScript MCP server framework supporting multiple transports
- **Node.js 20+**: Runtime environment
- **Vitest 3.1+**: Testing framework with coverage and integration support
- **AO Connect 0.0.85**: Interface to AO ecosystem
- **Arweave 1.15+**: Permanent data storage

**Testing Framework** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **Vitest 3.1+**: Primary testing framework with built-in coverage support
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Code quality and formatting for test files
- **TypeScript ESLint**: Advanced linting for TypeScript test code

**Server Architecture** [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#project-structure]

Current server implementation provides extensive tool categories:

```
src/tools/
├── memory/       # Memory management tools
├── process/      # AO process tools
├── token/        # Token operation tools
├── contact/      # Contact management tools
├── documentation/# Documentation tools
├── hub/          # Hub management tools
└── user/         # User tools
```

**Tool Factory Pattern** [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#tool-organization]

Each tool category follows established factory pattern:

- `ToolFactory.ts`: Factory class for tool registration
- `commands/`: Individual command implementations
- `index.ts`: Exports for the tool category
- Two-phase initialization: `setupToolRegistry()` then tool registration
- Context injection with keyPair, hubId, embeddedTemplates, publicKey

### Technical Implementation Details

**MCP Client Integration Requirements**

MCP client library evaluation criteria and options:

- **@modelcontextprotocol/sdk**: Official MCP SDK - Priority 1 (verify availability and TypeScript support)
- **FastMCP Client**: Check if FastMCP 1.27.3 provides client functionality for testing
- **Custom Client Implementation**: HTTP/SSE client as fallback if official options unavailable

**Selection Priority:**

1. First evaluate @modelcontextprotocol/sdk for completeness and compatibility
2. If unavailable, investigate FastMCP client capabilities
3. Custom implementation only if neither option provides adequate testing support

**Server Transport Configuration** [Source: Story 10.1 completion]

Transport configuration already implemented in `src/constants.ts` and `src/server.ts`:

```typescript
// Example transport configuration
const transportConfig = getTransportConfig();
server.start(transportConfig);
```

Supported test transports from Story 10.1:

- **SSE Transport**: `{ transportType: "sse", sse: { endpoint: "/endpoint", port: number } }`
- **HTTP Stream Transport**: `{ transportType: "httpStream", httpStream: { endpoint: "/endpoint", port: number } }`

**Existing Testing Infrastructure** [Source: tests/ directory structure]

Current test organization supports this story:

- **Integration Tests Directory**: `tests/integration/` with established `.integration.test.ts` naming
- **Test Helpers**: `tests/helpers/memory-test-helpers.ts` shows helper pattern available
- **Existing Integration Tests**: 15 integration test files showing established patterns
- **Server Test Mode**: `tests/integration/server-test-mode.integration.test.ts` provides server testing foundation

### File Locations

**Existing Files** [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

- `src/server.ts`: Main MCP server implementation with transport support
- `src/constants.ts`: Configuration constants including transport configuration functions
- `tests/integration/`: Integration test directory following `.integration.test.ts` naming convention
- `tests/helpers/`: Helper functions directory for test utilities
- `tests/helpers/memory-test-helpers.ts`: Existing test helper pattern example

**Files to Create**

- `tests/integration/mcp-client-integration.integration.test.ts`: Main MCP client integration test suite
- `tests/helpers/mcp-client-test-helper.ts`: MCP client helper utilities for test setup
- `tests/integration/tools/` (optional): Directory for tool category integration tests if additional organization needed

**Integration Points**

- FastMCP framework transport system (leveraging Story 10.1 implementation)
- MCP protocol client library integration
- Existing tool factory and registration system
- Test environment configuration and CI pipeline

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Standards** [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

Following established TypeScript and testing conventions:

- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Full strict mode enabled for all test files
- **ES Modules**: Use ES modules with `.js` extensions for local imports
- **File Naming**: Use `.integration.test.ts` suffix for integration tests
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with meaningful error messages

**Testing Framework Patterns** [Source: CLAUDE.md#testing-strategy]

Using Vitest framework with comprehensive coverage:

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach, vi } from "vitest";

// Mock external dependencies
vi.mock("../../../src/relay.js", () => ({
  event: vi.fn(),
  fetchEvents: vi.fn(),
}));

describe("MCP Client Integration", () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    vi.clearAllMocks();
  });

  it("should connect to server via test transport", async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

**MCP Client Testing Patterns**

- Client connection lifecycle management
- Protocol handshake validation
- Tool request/response validation
- Error scenario testing
- Connection recovery testing
- Performance and reliability testing

### Technical Constraints

**MCP Protocol Compliance**

- Maintain full MCP message protocol support through client testing
- Ensure client-server communication follows MCP specification
- Validate tool request/response formats match MCP standards
- Test protocol error handling and edge cases

**FastMCP Framework Integration**

- Leverage existing FastMCP 1.27.3 transport capabilities from Story 10.1
- Maintain compatibility with stdio (default), SSE, and HTTP Stream transports
- Work within FastMCP client/server architecture patterns
- Preserve existing tool functionality and registration patterns

**CI/CD Environment Requirements**

- Tests must run reliably in headless CI environment without interactive dependencies
- Use test transport modes (SSE/HTTP) instead of stdio for CI compatibility
- Ensure test isolation and parallel execution capabilities
- Provide clear error reporting for CI pipeline failures

**Coding Standards Compliance** [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **TypeScript**: Full strict mode enabled, explicit typing preferred
- **ES Modules**: Use ES modules with `.js` extensions for local imports
- **File Naming**: Use `.integration.test.ts` suffix for integration test files
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch with meaningful error messages
- **Code Quality**: Follow Prettier formatting and ESLint linting standards

### Security Considerations

- MCP client testing should use localhost-only connections in test mode
- Test environment should not expose server endpoints externally
- Authentication and key management testing should use test fixtures
- Sensitive operations should be mocked or use test-safe implementations
- Test data should be isolated and cleaned up after test execution

### Project Structure Notes

The existing project structure aligns well with this story requirements:

- **Integration test directory**: `tests/integration/` already established with 20+ existing tests
- **Helper utilities**: `tests/helpers/` directory available for MCP client helpers
- **Tool organization**: Modular tool structure supports comprehensive testing by category
- **Transport infrastructure**: Story 10.1 provided necessary transport configuration foundation
- **Testing framework**: Vitest 3.1+ with coverage already configured and working

No structural conflicts identified. The implementation can leverage existing patterns and infrastructure.
