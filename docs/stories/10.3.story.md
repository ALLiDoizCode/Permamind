## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 10.1 (Implement Test Mode Transport for MCP Server):

- FastMCP 1.27.3 supports 3 transport types: stdio (default), sse (Server-Sent Events), and httpStream (HTTP Stream)
- TEST_TRANSPORT, TEST_TRANSPORT_PORT, and TEST_TRANSPORT_ENDPOINT environment variables implemented
- Server startup modified to support transport configuration with backward compatibility
- Transport selection logic successfully implemented in `src/constants.ts` and `src/server.ts`
- Integration test infrastructure exists at `tests/integration/server-test-mode.integration.test.ts`

From Story 10.2 (Create MCP Client Integration Tests):

- Successfully integrated `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` v1.17.3 as the official TypeScript MCP client library
- Created comprehensive `mcp-client-test-helper.ts` with utilities for server startup, client connection, and test isolation
- Implemented complete integration test suite covering all tool categories: Memory, Process, Token, User, Hub, and Documentation
- Added optional MCP client tests to GitHub Actions (triggered with `[mcp]` in PR title)
- Updated Vitest configuration with increased timeouts and proper isolation for MCP integration tests

### Architecture Context

**Technology Stack** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

Core project technology requirements:

- **TypeScript 5.8+**: Primary language with strict typing
- **FastMCP 1.27+**: TypeScript MCP server framework supporting multiple transports
- **Node.js 20+**: Runtime environment
- **Vitest 3.1+**: Testing framework with coverage and integration support
- **AO Connect 0.0.85**: Interface to AO ecosystem
- **Arweave 1.15+**: Permanent data storage

**Testing Framework** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **Vitest 3.1+**: Primary testing framework with built-in coverage support
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Code quality and formatting for test files
- **TypeScript ESLint**: Advanced linting for TypeScript test code

**Server Architecture** [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

Current server implementation provides extensive tool categories:

```
src/tools/
├── memory/       # Memory management tools
├── process/      # AO process tools
├── token/        # Token operation tools
├── contact/      # Contact management tools
├── documentation/# Documentation tools
├── hub/          # Hub management tools
└── user/         # User tools
```

**Tool Factory Pattern** [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
Each tool category follows established factory pattern:

- `ToolFactory.ts`: Factory class for tool registration
- `commands/`: Individual command implementations
- `index.ts`: Exports for the tool category
- Two-phase initialization: `setupToolRegistry()` then tool registration
- Context injection with keyPair, hubId, embeddedTemplates, publicKey

### Technical Implementation Details

**Current Documentation Structure**
Based on existing README.md structure and documentation organization:

- README.md has sections for Quick Start, Configuration, Usage Examples, and Contributing
- Missing comprehensive Testing section explaining constraints and limitations
- References to non-existent files: `docs/contributing.md`, `docs/examples.md`, `docs/performance.md`
- Documentation files exist in `docs/architecture/` but no testing-specific documentation

**Test Infrastructure** [Source: vitest.config.ts and package.json]

Current test configuration and scripts:

- Vitest 3.1+ with coverage reporting configured
- Test timeouts increased to 45s for MCP client integration tests
- Node environment with single fork pool for test isolation
- Package scripts include `test`, `test:coverage`, `test:mcp-client`, `test:integration`
- NODE_ENV explicitly set to "test" to prevent mainnet endpoint usage

**GitHub Actions Configuration** [Source: .github/workflows/pr-validation.yml]

Current CI/CD pipeline structure:

- Multi-job workflow with quality-checks, test-suite, cross-platform-build, performance-check
- Optional MCP client integration tests (triggered with `[mcp]` in PR title)
- Test environment variables: NODE_ENV=test, SEED_PHRASE for CI testing
- Standard integration tests exclude MCP client tests for CI stability
- Comprehensive validation with coverage thresholds and cross-platform testing

**MCP Server Transport Architecture** [Source: src/constants.ts and src/server.ts]

Transport configuration capabilities established in previous stories:

- Default stdio transport for interactive client connections
- SSE transport option: `{ transportType: "sse", sse: { endpoint: "/endpoint", port: number } }`
- HTTP Stream transport option: `{ transportType: "httpStream", httpStream: { endpoint: "/endpoint", port: number } }`
- Environment variable configuration: TEST_TRANSPORT, TEST_TRANSPORT_PORT, TEST_TRANSPORT_ENDPOINT
- Backward compatibility maintained with stdio as default

### File Locations

**Existing Files to Modify**

- `README.md`: Add comprehensive Testing section [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- Update references to missing documentation files

**Files to Create**

- `docs/developer-testing-guide.md`: Comprehensive developer testing guide
- `docs/contributing.md`: Referenced in README but missing
- `docs/examples.md`: Referenced in README but missing
- `docs/performance.md`: Referenced in README but missing

**Integration Points**

- FastMCP framework transport system (leveraging Story 10.1 implementation)
- MCP client library integration from Story 10.2 (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk)
- Existing test infrastructure and GitHub Actions workflow
- Current vitest configuration and package.json test scripts

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Standards** [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

Following established TypeScript and testing conventions:

- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Full strict mode enabled for all test files
- **ES Modules**: Use ES modules with `.js` extensions for local imports
- **File Naming**: Use `.integration.test.ts` suffix for integration tests
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with meaningful error messages

**Documentation Testing Standards**

- All code examples in documentation must be tested and verified
- Configuration examples must match actual implementation
- Troubleshooting steps must be validated against real scenarios
- Cross-reference all technical details with source implementations

### Technical Constraints

**MCP Protocol Design Limitations**

- Server designed for interactive stdio transport with MCP clients
- CI environments conflict with stdio-based communication patterns
- Test transport modes (SSE/HTTP) required for automated testing
- Protocol handshake and tool registration timing requirements

**FastMCP Framework Integration**

- Maintain compatibility with FastMCP 1.27.3 transport capabilities
- Work within existing server initialization and tool registration patterns
- Preserve backward compatibility with stdio transport as default
- Document framework-specific testing patterns and limitations

**CI/CD Environment Requirements**

- Tests must run reliably in headless CI environment
- Use test transport modes instead of stdio for CI compatibility
- Ensure test isolation and parallel execution capabilities
- Provide clear error reporting for CI pipeline failures

**Coding Standards Compliance** [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **Documentation**: Follow project documentation standards and formatting
- **File Naming**: Use descriptive names following established conventions
- **Error Handling**: Provide clear troubleshooting guidance with meaningful solutions
- **Code Quality**: All documentation examples must follow Prettier and ESLint standards

### Security Considerations

- Document test environment security best practices
- Explain test seed phrase usage and limitations
- Provide guidance on avoiding exposure of sensitive data in testing
- Document secure CI environment configuration patterns

### Project Structure Notes

The project structure aligns well with documentation requirements:

- **Documentation directory**: `docs/` already established with architecture subdirectory
- **README structure**: Existing structure supports additional Testing section
- **Testing infrastructure**: Comprehensive test setup from Stories 10.1 and 10.2
- **CI configuration**: Established GitHub Actions workflow ready for documentation updates
- **Missing files**: Several documentation files referenced in README need creation

No structural conflicts identified. The documentation can leverage existing patterns and infrastructure.
