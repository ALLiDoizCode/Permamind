2. Integrate AWS S3 SDK client configuration for Load Network endpoint (`https://s3-node-0.load.network/~s3@1.0`)
3. Add bucket management operations (create, list, delete) with proper error handling and retry logic
4. Implement secure access key management through environment variables
5. Follow existing TypeScript strict mode and error handling patterns from PermawebDeployService
6. Include comprehensive unit tests with mock S3 client for reliable testing
7. Add service documentation following existing Permamind service standards

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 10.1 (Implement Test Mode Transport for MCP Server):

- Demonstrated strong environment variable configuration patterns using constants.ts
- Used comprehensive testing approach with both unit and integration tests
- Showed excellent TypeScript strict mode adherence and error handling
- Implemented graceful fallback mechanisms and backward compatibility
- Used FastMCP framework integration patterns successfully
- Applied comprehensive prerequisite checking before main operations

### Data Models

**Service Interface Pattern** [Source: src/services/PermawebDeployService.ts#48-89]

Existing services follow consistent patterns:

- Constructor with optional configuration
- Result interfaces with success/error structure
- Comprehensive error handling with detailed error objects
- Async operations with proper TypeScript typing

```typescript
export interface ServiceResult {
  success: boolean;
  error?: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    details?: unknown;
    solutions?: string[];
  };
}
```

**Environment Variable Patterns** [Source: src/constants.ts#75-99]

Configuration management follows established patterns:

- Function-based configuration getters
- Default values for optional settings
- Type validation for configuration values
- Environment variable validation with meaningful error messages

### API Specifications

**Load Network S3 Configuration** [Source: Epic 11#32-60]

Load Network S3 service requirements:

- **Endpoint**: `https://s3-node-0.load.network/~s3@1.0`
- **Region**: `eu-west-2` (required)
- **Authentication**: Access key only (empty secret key required)
- **Path Style**: Force path style required (`forcePathStyle: true`)
- **Operations**: Create/list/delete buckets, put/get/delete/list objects, head object

**S3Client Configuration Pattern** [Source: Epic 11#47-72]

```typescript
this.s3Client = new S3Client({
  region: "eu-west-2",
  endpoint: "https://s3-node-0.load.network/~s3@1.0",
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: process.env.LOAD_NETWORK_ACCESS_KEY || "",
    secretAccessKey: "", // Load Network requires empty secret key
  },
  forcePathStyle: true, // Required for Load Network compatibility
});
```

### Component Specifications

**Service Architecture** [Source: src/services/PermawebDeployService.ts#48-410]

LoadNetworkStorageService should follow the established service pattern:

- Class-based service with constructor configuration
- Public async methods for main operations
- Private utility methods for internal logic
- Comprehensive error handling with detailed error objects
- Result interfaces following success/error structure
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout

**Error Handling Pattern** [Source: src/services/PermawebDeployService.ts#94-128]

```typescript
try {
  // Main operation logic
  const result = await this.performOperation();
  return {
    success: true,
    data: result,
  };
} catch (error) {
  return {
    success: false,
    error: {
      code: "OPERATION_FAILED",
      message:
        error instanceof Error ? error.message : "Unknown error occurred",
      details: error,
    },
  };
}
```

### File Locations

**Primary Files** [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#5-40]

- `src/services/LoadNetworkStorageService.ts`: Main service implementation
- `src/models/`: Data models and interfaces (if needed)
- `src/constants.ts`: Environment variable configuration functions
- `tests/unit/services/LoadNetworkStorageService.unit.test.ts`: Unit tests following naming convention

**Dependencies** [Source: package.json dependencies]

- `@aws-sdk/client-s3`: Already installed (^3.864.0) - S3 client library
- `vitest`: Testing framework for unit tests
- Existing TypeScript and ESLint configuration

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Framework** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#12-16]

- **Vitest 3.1+**: Testing framework with coverage reporting
- **Mock Strategy**: Use vi.mock() for external dependencies
- **Test Organization**: describe() blocks with beforeEach() setup

**Testing Patterns** [Source: tests/unit/services/PermawebDocsService.unit.test.ts#1-293]

```typescript
import { beforeEach, describe, expect, it, vi } from "vitest";
import { LoadNetworkStorageService } from "../../../src/services/LoadNetworkStorageService.js";

// Mock AWS S3 SDK
vi.mock("@aws-sdk/client-s3", () => ({
  S3Client: vi.fn(),
  CreateBucketCommand: vi.fn(),
  ListBucketsCommand: vi.fn(),
  // ... other S3 commands
}));

describe("LoadNetworkStorageService", () => {
  let service: LoadNetworkStorageService;

  beforeEach(() => {
    vi.clearAllMocks();
    service = new LoadNetworkStorageService();
  });

  it("should handle normal operation", async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

**Test Coverage Requirements** [Source: CLAUDE.md#testing-strategy]

- **Unit Tests**: Individual service method testing with mocked S3Client
- **Coverage Targets**: 90% functions, 85% lines, 75% branches
- **Error Scenarios**: Network failures, invalid configurations, missing environment variables
- **Success Scenarios**: All bucket and object operations with proper assertions

### Technical Constraints

**TypeScript Requirements** [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#1-31]

- **Strict Mode**: Full TypeScript strict mode enabled
- **Type Safety**: Explicit typing preferred, avoid `any`
- **ES Modules**: Use ES modules with `.js` extensions for local imports
- **Interface Usage**: Use interfaces for data structures

**File Naming Standards** [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#25-31]

- **Services**: PascalCase with Service suffix (`LoadNetworkStorageService.ts`)
- **Tests**: `.unit.test.ts` suffix for unit tests
- **Imports**: ES modules with `.js` extensions

**Load Network Constraints** [Source: Epic 11#186-201]

- **Beta Service**: Load Network S3 is in beta with potential service changes
- **Regional Limitation**: eu-west-2 region only - no failover regions available
- **Storage Capacity**: Current ~300TB storage space constraint
- **Authentication Model**: Unique access-key-only auth pattern different from standard S3

### Security Considerations

**Environment Variable Security** [Source: src/services/PermawebDeployService.ts#231-268]

- Access keys stored in environment variables only
- Validation of required environment variables at startup
- No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data in code
- Clear error messages for missing configuration without exposing sensitive details

**Service Isolation** [Source: Epic 11#194-206]

- Service operates independently without affecting existing functionality
- Graceful degradation when Load Network service is unavailable
- Comprehensive error handling prevents service crashes
- File size validation to prevent storage quota issues

## Testing

### Test File Locations

- Unit tests: `tests/unit/services/LoadNetworkStorageService.unit.test.ts`
- Mock configurations for S3Client and all S3 command classes

### Test Standards [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#12-16]

- **Testing Framework**: Vitest 3.1+ with coverage reporting and mocking capabilities
- **Test Structure**: Individual unit tests with describe() blocks and proper setup/teardown
- **Coverage Targets**: 90% functions, 85% lines, 75% branches
- **Mocking Strategy**: Mock external dependencies using vi.mock()

### Testing Frameworks and Patterns [Source: tests/unit/services/PermawebDocsService.unit.test.ts#1-50]

- **Vitest**: Primary testing framework with built-in mocking capabilities
- **Mock Pattern**: Use vi.mock() for AWS S3 SDK dependencies
- **Test Organization**: describe() blocks for test grouping, beforeEach() for setup
- **Assertions**: expect() assertions with proper error message validation

### Specific Testing Requirements for This Story

- S3Client configuration validation with Load Network-specific settings
- Bucket management operation testing (create, list, delete)
- Object storage operation testing (upload, download, delete, list)
- Environment variable validation and error handling
- Error scenarios for network failures and invalid configurations
- Success scenarios with proper result validation
- Mock S3 responses for comprehensive test coverage
