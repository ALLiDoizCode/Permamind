# Story 11.3: Integrate Media Storage with AI Memory System

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** Permamind user,

4. Create media-enriched memory templates that include file references and descriptions
5. Support media file validation and integrity checking for referenced files
6. Enable memory search by media type and file metadata
7. Maintain backward compatibility with existing memory operations and data structures
8. Add integration tests verifying media-memory workflows with existing aiMemoryService patterns

### Data Models

**AIMemory Interface Structure** [Source: src/models/AIMemory.ts#3-10]

Current AIMemory interface that needs extension:

```typescript
export interface AIMemory extends Memory {
  context: MemoryContext;
  importance: number; // 0-1 relevance score
  memoryType: MemoryType;
  metadata: MemoryMetadata;
  reasoning?: ReasoningTrace;
  relationships?: MemoryLink[];
}
```

**MemoryContext Interface** [Source: src/models/AIMemory.ts#61-72]

Current MemoryContext that needs media extension:

```typescript
export interface MemoryContext {
  chunkIndex?: number;
  domain?: string;
  relatedMemories?: string[];
  section?: string;
  sessionId?: string;
  sourceType?: ContextSourceType;
  sourceUrl?: string;
  topic?: string;
  totalChunks?: number;
  // NEW: mediaReferences?: MediaReference[];
}
```

**MediaReference Interface Definition** [Source: Epic 11.3#149-160]

Required new interface for media file metadata:

```typescript
export interface MediaReference {
  fileId: string; // Unique identifier for the file
  fileName: string; // Original file name
  mimeType: string; // MIME type (e.g., 'image/png')
  size: number; // File size in bytes
  storageType: "temporal" | "permanent"; // Storage tier
  uploadDate: string; // ISO timestamp of upload
  url: string; // Access URL for the file
  checksum?: string; // Optional integrity checksum
}
```

### API Specifications

**AIMemoryService Interface Extensions** [Source: src/services/aiMemoryService.ts#39-100]

Required new methods for media integration:

```typescript
// Media reference operations
addMediaReferenceToMemory: (
  signer: JWKInterface,
  hubId: string,
  memoryId: string,
  mediaReference: MediaReference,
) => Promise<string>;

// Media validation
validateMediaReferences: (mediaReferences: MediaReference[]) =>
  Promise<ValidationResult>;

// Media search operations
searchByMediaType: (hubId: string, mimeType: string, filters?: SearchFilters) =>
  Promise<AIMemory[]>;

// Media promotion workflow
promoteMediaToPermanent: (
  signer: JWKInterface,
  hubId: string,
  fileId: string,
) => Promise<MediaReference>;
```

**LoadNetworkStorageService Integration** [Source: src/services/LoadNetworkStorageService.ts interface]

Available methods for media file operations:

- `uploadFile(params: UploadFileParams): Promise<UploadFileResult>`
- `downloadFile(params: DownloadFileParams): Promise<DownloadFileResult>`
- `listFiles(params: ListFilesParams): Promise<ListFilesResult>`
- `getFileMetadata(params: FileMetadataParams): Promise<FileMetadata>`

### Component Specifications

**Service Architecture Pattern** [Source: src/services/aiMemoryService.ts#39-100]

AIMemoryService follows established patterns:

- Interface-based service definition with async methods
- Comprehensive error handling with meaningful error messages
- Result interfaces following success/error structure
- JWKInterface signer parameter for Arweave operations
- hubId parameter for hub-specific operations

**Memory Event Structure** [Source: src/services/aiMemoryService.ts#16-27]

Memory kinds and event handling:

```typescript
const MEMORY_KINDS = {
  AI_MEMORY: "10",
  CONTACT_MAPPING: "31",
  CONTEXT_DOCUMENTATION: "50",
  MEMORY_CONTEXT: "40",
  MEMORY_RELATIONSHIP: "11",
  REASONING_CHAIN: "23",
  TOKEN_MAPPING: "30",
} as const;
```

### File Locations

- `src/models/MediaReference.ts`: New interface for media file metadata
- `src/models/AIMemory.ts`: Extend existing interfaces for media support
- `src/services/aiMemoryService.ts`: Extend existing service for media operations
- `tests/integration/media-memory.integration.test.ts`: Integration tests for media-memory workflows

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Framework** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#13]

- **Vitest 3.1+**: Testing framework with coverage reporting
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end media-memory workflow testing
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock LoadNetworkStorageService for unit tests

**Testing Patterns** [Source: aiMemoryService existing patterns]

```typescript
import { beforeEach, describe, expect, it, vi } from "vitest";

// Mock LoadNetworkStorageService
vi.mock("../../src/services/LoadNetworkStorageService.js", () => ({
  LoadNetworkStorageService: vi.fn(),
}));

describe("AIMemoryService Media Integration", () => {
  let service: AIMemoryService;
  let mockSigner: JWKInterface;

  beforeEach(() => {
    vi.clearAllMocks();
    service = aiMemoryService;
    mockSigner = {} as JWKInterface;
  });

  it("should add media reference to memory successfully", async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### Technical Constraints

**TypeScript Requirements** [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#1-8]

- **Strict Mode**: Full TypeScript strict mode enabled
- **Type Safety**: Explicit typing preferred, avoid `any`
- **ES Modules**: Use ES modules with `.js` extensions for local imports
- **Interface Usage**: Use interfaces for data structures

**File Naming Standards** [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#25-31]

- **Models**: PascalCase (`MediaReference.ts`)
- **Services**: camelCase with service suffix (`aiMemoryService.ts`)
- **Tests**: `.integration.test.ts` suffix for integration tests
- **Imports**: ES modules with `.js` extensions

**Backward Compatibility Requirements** [Source: Epic 11.3#142]

- All existing AIMemory interfaces must remain unchanged
- New mediaReferences fields must be optional
- Existing memory operations must continue to work
- No breaking changes to existing data structures
- Graceful handling of memories without media references

### Security Considerations

**Media File Validation** [Source: Story 11.2 security patterns]

- File type validation using mime-types library
- File size limits to prevent storage exhaustion
- Checksum validation for integrity checking
- URL validation for media access
- Input sanitization for all media metadata

**Access Control** [Source: aiMemoryService existing patterns]

- Media references scoped to specific hubId
- Signer validation for all memory operations
- File access validation through LoadNetworkStorageService
- Error messages that don't expose system internals

## Testing

### Test File Locations

- Integration tests: `tests/integration/media-memory.integration.test.ts`
- Unit tests for MediaReference model validation
- Extended tests for aiMemoryService media methods

### Test Standards [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#13]

- **Testing Framework**: Vitest 3.1+ with coverage reporting and mocking capabilities
- **Test Structure**: Integration tests for complete media-memory workflows
- **Coverage Targets**: 90% functions, 85% lines, 75% branches
- **Mocking Strategy**: Mock LoadNetworkStorageService for isolated testing

### Specific Testing Requirements for This Story

- Media reference creation and validation workflows
- Memory creation with media attachments
- Media-based search and filtering capabilities
- Media promotion workflow (temporal → permanent)
- File integrity checking and validation
- Backward compatibility with existing memories without media
- Integration with LoadNetworkStorageService operations
- Error scenarios for missing files, invalid references, and permission issues

## Project Structure Notes

The media-memory integration follows the established project structure:

```
src/
├── models/
│   ├── AIMemory.ts                 # Extended for media support
│   └── MediaReference.ts           # New interface for media metadata
├── services/
│   ├── aiMemoryService.ts          # Extended for media operations
│   └── LoadNetworkStorageService.ts # Already implemented (Story 11.1)
└── tools/media/                    # Already implemented (Story 11.2)
    ├── MediaToolFactory.ts
    └── commands/
        ├── UploadMediaCommand.ts
        ├── ListMediaFilesCommand.ts
        └── GetMediaFileCommand.ts
```

This structure maintains consistency with existing patterns while extending functionality for media-enhanced memories. All changes are additive and maintain backward compatibility with existing memory operations.
