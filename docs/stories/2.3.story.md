# Story 2.3: Auto-detect BMAD Installation for Slash Commands

## Status

Pending

## Story

**As a** Claude Code user,
**I want** slash commands to automatically detect if BMAD is installed in my project,
**so that** I get helpful guidance when BMAD is not available.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Slash commands detect if .bmad-core exists in current project
2. Provide helpful error messages if BMAD not installed
3. Auto-suggest @init if user tries slash commands without installation
4. Enable slash commands to work from any directory within BMAD-enabled project
5. Support multi-project workflows where some projects have BMAD and others don't
6. Graceful degradation when BMAD resources are unavailable

## Dev Notes

### BMAD Detection Strategy

**Project Root Detection Algorithm**:
1. Start from current working directory
2. Check for .bmad-core directory
3. If not found, move up one directory level
4. Repeat until .bmad-core found or filesystem root reached
5. Cache result for performance

**Directory Structure Validation**:
```typescript
interface BmadInstallation {
  path: string;
  valid: boolean;
  missingComponents: string[];
  version?: string;
  lastUpdated?: Date;
}

class BmadProjectDetector {
  async detectInstallation(startPath: string): Promise<BmadInstallation | null>;
  async validateInstallation(bmadPath: string): Promise<boolean>;
  isValidBmadDirectory(path: string): boolean;
}
```

**Required Components Check**:
- `.bmad-core/agents/` directory with expected agent files
- `.bmad-core/tasks/` directory with expected task files  
- `.bmad-core/templates/` directory with expected template files
- `.bmad-core/checklists/` directory with expected checklist files
- `.bmad-core/workflows/` directory with expected workflow files
- `.bmad-core/data/` directory with data files

### Error Message Templates

**BMAD Not Installed**:
```
‚ùå BMAD not found in this project

To use BMAD slash commands, you need to install BMAD first:

1. Run: @init
2. This will install the complete BMAD methodology
3. Then you can use commands like /analyst, /create-doc, /architecture

Available BMAD resources after installation:
‚Ä¢ 10 Agent personas (/analyst, /architect, /dev, etc.)
‚Ä¢ 20 Development tasks (/create-doc, /execute-checklist, etc.)
‚Ä¢ 15 Document templates (/architecture, /prd, /story, etc.)
‚Ä¢ 7 Quality checklists (/architect-checklist, /pm-checklist, etc.)
‚Ä¢ 6 Development workflows (/greenfield-fullstack, /brownfield-service, etc.)
```

**Incomplete Installation**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  BMAD installation incomplete

Missing components: {missingComponents}

To fix this:
1. Run: @init --overwrite
2. This will update your BMAD installation
3. Or run: @init --repair to fix missing components
```

**Multi-project Context**:
```
üí° This project doesn't have BMAD, but others do

Current project: No BMAD installation
Other projects with BMAD: {otherProjects}

To use BMAD here: @init
To switch to BMAD project: cd {nearestBmadProject}
```

### Integration Points

**Slash Command Integration** [Source: Story 2.2]:
```typescript
abstract class BaseSlashCommand {
  protected async ensureBmadAvailable(): Promise<BmadInstallation> {
    const installation = await this.detector.detectInstallation(process.cwd());
    if (!installation) {
      throw new BmadNotInstalledError(this.generateInstallationGuidance());
    }
    return installation;
  }
}
```

**Performance Considerations**:
- Cache detection results per directory for 5 minutes
- Use async file system operations to avoid blocking
- Minimal overhead for projects without BMAD
- Efficient parent directory traversal

### File Locations

**Files to Create**:
- Detection Service: `src/services/BmadProjectDetector.ts`
- Error Classes: `src/errors/BmadInstallationErrors.ts`
- Message Templates: `src/templates/BmadErrorMessages.ts`
- Tests: `tests/unit/services/BmadProjectDetector.unit.test.ts`

**Files to Modify**:
- Base Command: `src/tools/slash/BaseSlashCommand.ts` (add detection)
- Command Registry: `src/services/BmadSlashCommandRegistry.ts` (integrate detection)
- All Slash Commands: Add detection check to execution

## Testing

### Test Cases Required

**Detection Algorithm Tests**:
- Project root detection from various starting directories
- Handling of symbolic links and alternate structures
- Performance testing with deep directory trees
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

**Installation Validation Tests**:
- Complete installation validation
- Partial installation detection
- Corrupted installation handling
- Version compatibility checking

**Error Message Tests**:
- Appropriate error messages for different scenarios
- Auto-suggestion generation
- Message formatting for Claude Code interface
- Internationalization support (if needed)

**Multi-project Tests**:
- Switching between BMAD and non-BMAD projects
- Concurrent usage across multiple projects
- Cache invalidation when switching contexts
- Monorepo and nested project handling

**Performance Tests**:
- Detection speed benchmarks
- Cache effectiveness measurement
- Memory usage optimization
- Minimal overhead verification

**Graceful Degradation Tests**:
- Alternative functionality when BMAD unavailable
- Partial functionality preservation
- Error recovery and continuation
- User workflow preservation
