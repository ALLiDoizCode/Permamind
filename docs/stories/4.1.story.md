### Claude Desktop Integration Overview

**Story 4.1 Overview** [Source: Epic 4 Agent UX Enhancement]:

This story implements conversation-based agent activation for Claude Desktop environment through:

- **Conversation Name Analysis**: Parse conversation titles for agent role indicators

**No Structural Conflicts Expected** [Source: Architecture compatibility]:

- Conversation services will extend existing service patterns
