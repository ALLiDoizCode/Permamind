## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**Key Learnings from Story 4.1 (ao Skill):**
[Source: docs/stories/4.1.story.md]

Story 4.1 successfully created the first bootstrap skill and validated the entire publish/install workflow:

- YAML frontmatter structure works correctly with gray-matter parser
- Token count target of 3-5k (actual: ~4,694 tokens) is optimal for skill content
- Progressive disclosure pattern effective: Overview → Concepts → Examples → Resources
- Code examples with inline comments highly effective for learning
- "When to Use This Skill" section provides clear activation criteria
- Self-contained skills with zero dependencies work well
- Publishing workflow validated (Arweave upload, AO registry registration)
- Installation testing showed AO network propagation delays (expected behavior)

**Key Learnings from Story 4.2 (arweave Skill):**
[Source: docs/stories/4.2.story.md]

Story 4.2 followed the same successful pattern as 4.1:

- Used identical YAML frontmatter structure (proven successful)
- Similar section organization for consistency
- Target ~4,500 tokens achieved (~3,100 tokens actual, within 3-5k range)
- Three complete code examples matching skill complexity
- All technical details cite architecture sources
- Security best practices emphasized (wallet protection)
- Publishing successful with similar bundle size (~6.7 KB vs 6.5 KB)
- Same AO network delay patterns observed during install testing

**Story 4.3 Focus:**

This story is about quality assurance, not implementation. The tasks focus on:
- **Consistency verification** across both completed skills
- **Technical accuracy** validation against architecture docs
- **Educational quality** assessment for ecosystem standards
- **End-to-end testing** of publish/search/install workflows
- **Documentation updates** to showcase bootstrap content

No coding required - this is content review and validation only.

- Process model (isolated actors, message passing)
- Handler pattern (Handlers.add with matcher functions)
- ADP compliance (Info handler, self-documentation)
- Message passing (ao.send() patterns)
- State management (global Lua tables)
- Monolithic design (no external dependencies except json)
- Timestamp handling (msg.Timestamp, never os.time())

**arweave Skill Technical Details:**
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md:3-66 - Arweave Network API]

Must verify against:
- Permanent storage model (pay-once, store-forever)
- Transaction structure (data, tags, signature, target)
- Transaction IDs (43-character base64url)
- Wallet format (JWK - JSON Web Key)
- Balance units (winston: 1 AR = 1 trillion winston)
- Gateway URLs (arweave.net, g8way.io, ar-io.dev)
- Transaction finality (2-5 minute confirmation)
- Upload patterns (POST /tx)
- Download patterns (GET /{transactionId})
- Status polling (GET /tx/{transactionId}/status)

**Common Technical Errors to Check:**

- Diagrams or visual aids where helpful

**Consistent Voice:**

- Both skills should feel like they're from the same author/team
- Similar sentence structure and pacing
- Consistent terminology usage
- Matching level of technical depth
- Similar example quality and completeness

### Publishing and Installation Verification

**Publication Records:**
[Source: docs/stories/4.1.story.md and 4.2.story.md Dev Agent Records]

**ao Skill:**
- Published: Story 4.1
- Arweave TXID: [Check 4.1.story.md Dev Agent Record]
- Bundle size: ~6.5 KB
- Registry message: [Check 4.1.story.md Dev Agent Record]
- Status: Done

**arweave Skill:**
- Published: Story 4.2
- Arweave TXID: X-ZbOOCEDQgcpAKdvWP1IQMqccNpj6zmhi40_IZAGVA
- Bundle size: ~6.7 KB
- Registry message: Vm4ov36Iw1Jr0MoAkyOV19OmhT5pHfJMearTJNY40mw
- Status: Done

**Verification Steps:**

1. **Check Arweave Storage:**
   - Visit https://arweave.net/{TXID} for each skill
   - Verify bundle downloads successfully
   - Check bundle size and content-type

2. **Check Registry Registration:**
   - Query AO registry for skill metadata
   - Verify all metadata fields correct
   - Check registry message confirmations
