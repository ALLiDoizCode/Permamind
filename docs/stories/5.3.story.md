## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 5.1 (CreateProcess MCP Tool) and Story 5.2 (EvalProcess MCP Tool):

- ProcessToolFactory integration patterns established for both tools
- Tool registration and MCP integration patterns confirmed
- Error handling and response format consistency achieved
- AO Connect integration maintained compatibility
- Signer management and tool context patterns unified

### Integration Requirements

**Process Management Workflow Integration** [Source: Epic 5 requirements]:

The complete AO process lifecycle should support:

1. **Process Creation**: CreateProcessCommand spawns new AO process
2. **Code Evaluation**: EvalProcessCommand tests functionality and setup
3. **Process Communication**: ExecuteProcessActionCommand handles ongoing operations
4. **Message Querying**: QueryAOProcessMessagesCommand monitors process activity

**BMAD Workflow Integration** [Source: Epic 2 BMAD integration]:

- Process management tools should integrate with BMAD task execution
- Support AO development workflows within BMAD methodology
- Enable automated process creation and testing through BMAD templates
- Provide foundation for complete AO development lifecycle management

### Data Models

**Process Lifecycle Workflow State** [Source: Integration requirements]:

```typescript
interface ProcessLifecycleState {
  processId: string;
  creationResult: CreateProcessResponse;
  evaluationResults: EvalProcessResponse[];
  communicationHistory: ProcessActionResponse[];
  messageQuery: ProcessMessagesResponse;
}
```

**Tool Integration Context** [Source: ProcessToolFactory patterns]:

```typescript
interface ProcessToolIntegrationContext {
  createProcess: CreateProcessCommand;
  evalProcess: EvalProcessCommand;
  executeAction: ExecuteProcessActionCommand;
  queryMessages: QueryAOProcessMessagesCommand;
}
```

### API Specifications

**ProcessToolFactory Registration Pattern** [Source: Existing tool factory patterns]:

```typescript
export class ProcessToolFactory extends BaseToolFactory {
  protected getToolClasses(): Array<new (context: ToolContext) => ToolCommand> {
    return [
      ExecuteProcessActionCommand,
      QueryAOProcessMessagesCommand,
      CreateProcessCommand, // New tool
      EvalProcessCommand, // New tool
    ];
  }
}
```

**Complete Process Lifecycle API** [Source: Integration design]:

```typescript
// 1. Create process
const createResult = await createProcessTool.execute({});
const processId = JSON.parse(createResult).processId;

// 2. Evaluate initial code
const evalResult = await evalProcessTool.execute({
  processId,
  code: "return 'Process initialized'",
});

// 3. Execute process actions
const actionResult = await executeActionTool.execute({
  processId,
  action: "Custom action",
  // other parameters
});

// 4. Query process messages
const messagesResult = await queryMessagesTool.execute({
  processId,
  // query parameters
});
```

### Component Specifications

**ProcessToolFactory Integration** [Source: Tool factory patterns]:

```typescript
export class ProcessToolFactory extends BaseToolFactory {
  constructor() {
    super(
      "Process Management Tools",
      "Tools for AO process lifecycle management",
    );
  }

  protected getToolClasses(): Array<new (context: ToolContext) => ToolCommand> {
    return [
      // Existing tools
      ExecuteProcessActionCommand,
      QueryAOProcessMessagesCommand,
      // New process management tools
      CreateProcessCommand,
      EvalProcessCommand,
    ];
  }
}
```

**Integration Test Structure** [Source: Testing requirements]:

```typescript
describe("Process Management Integration", () => {
  describe("Complete Process Lifecycle", () => {
    it("should support create → evaluate → communicate → query workflow", async () => {
      // Test complete workflow integration
    });
  });

  describe("BMAD Workflow Integration", () => {
    it("should integrate with BMAD task execution", async () => {
      // Test BMAD integration patterns
    });
  });

  describe("Existing Tool Compatibility", () => {
    it("should preserve all existing process tool functionality", async () => {
      // Test no regression in existing tools

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-19

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Critical Architectural Issues Found and Fixed** - The initial implementation had fundamental architectural flaws that required immediate senior developer intervention. The implementation violated established patterns and would have caused runtime failures.

**Major Issues Identified and Resolved:**

1. **Constructor Pattern Violation**: CreateProcessCommand and EvalProcessCommand were using incorrect execute signatures, taking context as a parameter instead of injecting it via constructor
2. **Inconsistent Tool Architecture**: New tools violated the established ToolCommand pattern used by ExecuteActionCommand and other existing tools
3. **Missing 3-Second Delay**: CreateProcessCommand was missing the required 3-second initialization delay specified in requirements
4. **Test Architecture Mismatch**: Integration and unit tests were using incorrect constructor calls and execute signatures
5. **Schema Inconsistency**: EvalProcessCommand was not using CommonSchemas.processId for process ID validation

**Architecture Alignment After Fixes:**

- Perfect compliance with established ToolCommand pattern
- Proper constructor-based context injection matching existing tools
- Consistent execute signature across all process tools
- Full integration with ProcessToolFactory registration patterns

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `src/tools/process/commands/CreateProcessCommand.ts`

- **Change**: Added constructor to inject ToolContext, removed context parameter from execute method
- **Why**: Violated established pattern used by ExecuteActionCommand and other tools
- **How**: Ensures consistent architecture and proper context management across all tools
- **Change**: Added missing 3-second initialization delay
- **Why**: Requirement explicitly specified in AC 4 but was missing from implementation
- **How**: Improves user experience by allowing proper process initialization

**File**: `src/tools/process/commands/EvalProcessCommand.ts`

- **Change**: Added constructor to inject ToolContext, removed context parameter from execute method
- **Why**: Same architectural consistency issue as CreateProcessCommand
- **How**: Maintains uniform tool architecture across the entire system
- **Change**: Updated to use CommonSchemas.processId for validation
- **Why**: Ensures consistency with other process tools and centralized validation logic
- **How**: Reduces code duplication and maintains validation standards

**File**: `tests/unit/tools/process/CreateProcessCommand.unit.test.ts`

- **Change**: Updated all test cases to use constructor pattern and correct execute signature
- **Why**: Tests were failing due to architectural changes in implementation
- **How**: Ensures tests validate the correct implementation patterns

**File**: `tests/unit/tools/process/EvalProcessCommand.unit.test.ts`

- **Change**: Updated all test cases to use constructor pattern and correct execute signature
- **Why**: Same testing issue as CreateProcessCommand tests
- **How**: Maintains test coverage for correct implementation patterns

**File**: `tests/integration/ProcessManagementWorkflow.integration.test.ts`

- **Change**: Updated mock setup and tool initialization to use constructor pattern
- **Why**: Integration tests were failing due to incorrect tool instantiation
- **How**: Ensures integration tests validate real-world usage patterns

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Full compliance after refactoring - proper TypeScript patterns, constructor injection, consistent imports

### Security Review

✓ **Security Excellent After Fixes**:

- Proper context injection prevents unauthorized access to signing capabilities
- Constructor pattern ensures context validation at instantiation time
- Consistent error handling prevents information leakage
- Proper schema validation for all inputs maintains security boundaries

### Performance Considerations

✓ **Performance Optimal After Architectural Fixes**:
