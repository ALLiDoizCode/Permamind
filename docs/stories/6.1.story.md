- `analyst` ✅ **INCLUDED** - Business Analyst for requirements analysis and process modeling
- `architect` ✅ **INCLUDED** - Solution Architect for technical guidance
- `bmad-master` ✅ **INCLUDED** - Master coordinator for BMAD methodology implementation
- `developer` ✅ **INCLUDED** (as "dev") - Full Stack Developer for code implementation
- `devops` ✅ **INCLUDED** - DevOps for deployment and infrastructure
- `pm` ✅ **INCLUDED** - Project Manager for coordination and management
- `qa` ✅ **INCLUDED** - Quality Assurance for testing and review
- `sm` ✅ **INCLUDED** - Scrum Master for agile facilitation and team coaching

### Performance Considerations

**OPTIMAL** ✅ - Performance considerations properly addressed:

- Efficient regex patterns with word boundaries to prevent excessive backtracking
- Smart deduplication reduces redundant processing
- Context extraction limited to prevent memory issues
- Algorithm complexity is O(n\*m) where n=agents, m=patterns (acceptable for use case)

### Final Status

**✅ APPROVED - PRODUCTION READY**

This implementation represents exemplary TypeScript development with:

- **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns and dependency management
- **Robust Testing**: 100% coverage of new functionality with meaningful assertions
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript typing throughout
- **Performance**: Optimized algorithms for pattern matching and scoring
- **Maintainability**: Clear, self-documenting code with proper abstractions
