### Testing Requirements

**Unit Testing Strategy** [Source: tests/unit/mnemonic.unit.test.ts patterns]:

- Use Vitest framework with `vi.mock()` for isolating worker thread dependencies
- Mock Node.js `worker_threads` module for controlled testing
- Test message passing protocols between main thread and workers

- Mock progress callback functionality

**Integration Testing Requirements**:

- Verify worker pool behavior under concurrent load
- Test graceful shutdown scenarios
- Validate performance improvements over synchronous generation
- Test background pre-generation system integration

### Technical Constraints

**Node.js Worker Threads** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:

- Node.js 20+ runtime environment provides stable worker_threads API
- Worker threads share memory but require explicit message passing
- TypeScript compilation must support both main thread and worker contexts
- Worker thread cleanup essential to prevent resource leaks

**Integration with Existing Cache System** [Source: src/mnemonic.ts caching implementation]:

- Must maintain compatibility with existing memory and disk cache layers
- Worker-generated keys must integrate transparently with cache statistics
- Cache hit/miss tracking must account for async worker operations
- Maintain existing security constraints and file permissions

**Performance Requirements** [Source: Epic 6 performance targets]:

- Non-blocking operation: Main thread must remain responsive during generation
- Worker pool efficiency: Balance between resource usage and responsiveness
- Memory management: Prevent unbounded growth with concurrent requests
- Background pre-generation: Utilize idle resources without impacting active operations

### Project Structure Notes

The worker thread implementation aligns perfectly with the existing project structure:

- `src/mnemonic.ts` contains the core key generation logic to be enhanced
- Worker thread files follow the established `src/` organization pattern
- TypeScript interfaces follow the `src/types/` categorization
- Testing structure mirrors existing `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/` patterns
- No changes needed to tool categories or MCP server architecture
- Background processing integrates with existing Node.js 20+ runtime requirements

**Test Location**: `tests/unit/` for unit tests, `tests/integration/` for integration tests
