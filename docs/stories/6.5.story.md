# Story 6.5: Homepage Polish & Marketing Sections

<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** visitor to the Agent Skills Registry website,
**I want** a polished homepage with marketing/educational sections (How It Works, Quick Start, animations),
**so that** I can understand the value proposition, learn how to use the CLI, and be guided through getting started with clear visual polish matching the mockup design.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Hero section has animated gradient heading with smooth blue → green color animation
2. "How It Works" section displays 3 numbered cards (discover, install, activate) with icons and descriptions
3. Quick Start terminal block shows installation command with copy button integration
4. All homepage animations and transitions are polished and smooth
5. Smooth scroll behavior implemented for section navigation
6. Responsive design verified at 375px/768px/1440px viewports via Playwright
7. Playwright verification of all homepage sections and interactions during development
8. Performance optimization implemented (lazy loading, code splitting if needed)

    - [ ] Test responsive: Full-page screenshot at 375px and 1440px
  - [ ] Source reference: [Source: mockups/developer-cli/index.html - Full homepage structure]

- [x] **Task 5: Implement Smooth Scroll Behavior** (AC: 4, 5, 6, 7)
  - [ ] Add global smooth scroll behavior to `frontend/src/index.css`:
    - [ ] Add CSS rule: `html { scroll-behavior: smooth; }`
    - [ ] Ensure it doesn't conflict with existing styles
  - [ ] Verify smooth scroll works with:
    - [ ] Browser back/forward navigation (ScrollToTop component already handles this from Story 6.3)
    - [ ] Anchor link clicks (if any navigation links added later)
    - [ ] Page scrolling (mouse wheel, trackpad)
  - [ ] Add reduced-motion media query for accessibility:
    - [ ] `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) { html { scroll-behavior: auto; } }`
    - [ ] Respects user preference for reduced animations
  - [ ] Unit tests:
    - [ ] Verify `scroll-behavior: smooth` applied to html element (snapshot test of index.css)
    - [ ] Verify reduced-motion media query present
  - [ ] **MANDATORY Playwright Verification:**
    - [ ] Navigate to homepage
    - [ ] Scroll down slowly → Verify smooth scroll animation (not instant jump)
    - [ ] Navigate to search results page → Navigate back → Verify scrolls to top smoothly
    - [ ] Test reduced-motion: Enable reduced motion in browser settings → Verify scroll is instant (not smooth)
  - [ ] Source reference: [Source: Epic 6 AC 5 - Smooth scroll behavior for section navigation]

- [x] **Task 6: Polish Homepage Animations and Transitions** (AC: 4, 6, 7)
  - [ ] Review existing component transitions:
    - [ ] SkillCard hover effect (from Story 6.2) - verify smooth transition
    - [ ] Button hover effects (from Story 6.1) - verify transition-colors applied
    - [ ] SearchBar focus state (from Story 6.2) - verify smooth border/ring transition
  - [ ] Add missing transition polish:
    - [ ] Card hover effects in HowItWorksSection:
      - [ ] Add subtle scale on hover: `hover:scale-105 transition-transform duration-300`
      - [ ] Add subtle shadow on hover: `hover:shadow-lg hover:shadow-syntax-blue/10`
    - [ ] Category badge hover effects (CategoriesSection from Story 6.3):
      - [ ] Verify transition-colors is applied
      - [ ] Add scale on hover if not present: `hover:scale-110 transition-all`
  - [ ] Add fade-in animations for sections on initial page load (optional enhancement):
    - [ ] Use CSS animation or Framer Motion library (if time permits)
    - [ ] Stagger animations: Hero → Featured Skills → Categories → How It Works → Quick Start
    - [ ] Keep animations subtle (opacity: 0 → 1, translateY: 20px → 0)
  - [ ] Performance considerations:
    - [ ] Avoid animating width/height (use transform/opacity only)
    - [ ] Use will-change property sparingly (only for active animations)
    - [ ] Ensure 60fps performance on mobile devices
  - [ ] **MANDATORY Playwright Verification:**
    - [ ] Navigate to homepage
    - [ ] Hover over HowItWorksSection cards → Verify scale/shadow animation
    - [ ] Hover over category badges → Verify scale/color transition
    - [ ] Hover over skill cards → Verify existing hover effects still work
    - [ ] Test performance: Scroll page rapidly → Verify no jank or frame drops
    - [ ] Test on mobile viewport (375px) → Verify animations work smoothly
  - [ ] Source reference: [Source: mockups/developer-cli/index.html:112-131 - terminal-border hover effect]

- [x] **Task 7: Performance Optimization** (AC: 8, 6, 7)
  - [ ] Analyze bundle size and implement optimizations:
    - [ ] Run production build: `npm run build`
    - [ ] Check bundle size in `frontend/dist/assets/` directory
    - [ ] Identify large chunks (>500 KB) for code splitting
  - [ ] Implement code splitting (if needed):
    - [ ] Use React.lazy() for route-based code splitting:
      - [ ] `const Home = React.lazy(() => import('./pages/Home'))`
      - [ ] `const SearchResults = React.lazy(() => import('./pages/SearchResults'))`
      - [ ] `const SkillDetail = React.lazy(() => import('./pages/SkillDetail'))`
    - [ ] Add Suspense wrapper in App.tsx or routes/index.tsx:
      - [ ] `<Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>`
    - [ ] Verify code splitting works (separate chunks in dist/)
  - [ ] Implement lazy loading for images (if any large images added):
    - [ ] Add `loading="lazy"` attribute to img tags
    - [ ] Use Intersection Observer for custom lazy loading (advanced)
  - [ ] Optimize CSS:
    - [ ] Verify Tailwind CSS purge is enabled in production (Vite handles this automatically)
    - [ ] Check for unused CSS classes (unlikely with Tailwind purge)
  - [ ] Performance metrics:
    - [ ] Lighthouse score target: >90 for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices
    - [ ] Time to Interactive (TTI): <3 seconds on 3G network
    - [ ] First Contentful Paint (FCP): <1.5 seconds
  - [ ] Unit tests:

    - [ ] Mock React.lazy for testing (use jest.mock)
  - [ ] **MANDATORY Playwright Verification:**
    - [ ] Run production build: `npm run build`
    - [ ] Serve production build: `npx vite preview`
    - [ ] Navigate to homepage
    - [ ] Open DevTools → Network tab → Verify separate JS chunks loaded
    - [ ] Verify initial bundle size <500 KB (gzipped)
    - [ ] Navigate to search results → Verify lazy-loaded chunk fetched
    - [ ] Navigate to skill detail → Verify lazy-loaded chunk fetched
    - [ ] Test on simulated 3G network (DevTools throttling) → Verify page loads in <5 seconds

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**Key Learnings from Story 6.4 (Skill Detail Page & Advanced UI Components):**
[Source: docs/stories/6.4.story.md:1300-1420]

Story 6.4 delivered:
- **Advanced shadcn-ui Components**: Tabs (5 variants), Table, Input with terminal theme
- **Utility Components**: CopyButton, Breadcrumbs, MarkdownRenderer
- **Skill Detail Page**: Tabbed navigation (Overview, Installation, Dependencies, Versions, Files)
- **Data Integration**: AO registry via `Get-Skill` and `Get-Skill-Versions` handlers
- **Professional Architecture**: Clean separation, type safety, accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- **Playwright Workflow**: MANDATORY visual verification during development established
- **Test Coverage**: 29 new unit tests (100% passing), production build operational
- **Security**: XSS prevention in MarkdownRenderer, Clipboard API error handling
- **Performance**: React.useMemo, 5-minute query caching

**Story 6.5 Focus:**

This story completes the **homepage polish** with marketing/educational sections and visual animations to achieve full mockup parity:

- **Hero Section Enhancement**: Animated gradient heading (blue → green color shift)
- **How It Works Section**: 3 numbered cards with icons (discover, install, activate)
- **Quick Start Section**: Terminal-styled code block with CopyButton integration
- **Animation Polish**: Smooth scroll, card hover effects, gradient animation keyframes
- **Performance Optimization**: Code splitting (React.lazy), lazy loading, bundle size targets
- **Responsive Testing**: Final verification at 375px/768px/1440px viewports

**Critical Differences from Story 6.4:**
- Story 6.4: Advanced components for data-rich pages (tabs, tables, detail view)
- Story 6.5: Marketing/educational sections for homepage (How It Works, Quick Start)
- Story 6.4: Complex data integration (skill metadata, versions, dependencies)
- Story 6.5: Static content sections with animations and polish
- Story 6.4: Utility components (CopyButton created)
- Story 6.5: CopyButton reuse for Quick Start terminal block

**Story 6.4 CopyButton Status:**
✅ **Already Implemented** - CopyButton component ready for reuse:
- Location: `frontend/src/components/CopyButton.tsx`
- Features: Clipboard API, checkmark animation (2s timeout), error handling
- Props: `text: string`, `className?: string`
- Unit tests: 6 tests passing (clipboard copy, icon animation, timeout reset)

**Therefore Task 3 (Quick Start Section) should import and use existing CopyButton, NOT create it from scratch.**

- `pages/Home.tsx` - Add HowItWorksSection and QuickStartSection
- `index.css` - Add gradient animation keyframes, smooth scroll behavior

### Architecture Context

**Frontend Tech Stack:**
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md:19-55]

Frontend uses:
- **React 18** with TypeScript for UI components
- **Vite** for build tooling and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **shadcn-ui v4** for accessible, customizable component primitives
- **React Router v6** for client-side routing
- **@permaweb/aoconnect** with Randao CU/MU for AO process queries (not needed for Story 6.5)

**Tailwind CSS Configuration:**

Terminal color palette already configured from Story 6.1:
```javascript
colors: {
  terminal: {
    bg: '#10151B',
    surface: '#1a1f26',
    border: '#2d3748',
    text: '#e2e8f0',
    muted: '#94a3b8',
  },
  syntax: {
    blue: '#61afef',
    green: '#98c379',
    yellow: '#e5c07b',
    red: '#e06c75',
    purple: '#c678dd',
    cyan: '#56b6c2',
  },
}
```

**Animation Performance Best Practices:**
- Use `transform` and `opacity` for animations (GPU-accelerated)
- Avoid animating `width`, `height`, `top`, `left` (triggers layout reflow)
- Use `will-change` sparingly (only for active animations, remove after)
- Target 60fps (16.67ms per frame)

### Data Models

**No new data models needed** - Story 6.5 uses static content only (no AO registry queries).

**Static Content for How It Works Section:**
[Source: mockups/developer-cli/index.html:530-573]

```typescript
const HOW_IT_WORKS_STEPS = [
  {
    number: 1,
    title: '$ discover',
    description: 'Search the registry for agent skills that match your needs. Filter by category, author, or keywords.',
    color: 'blue' // syntax-blue
  },
  {
    number: 2,
    title: '$ install',
    description: 'Install skills via the CLI with a single command. Dependencies are handled automatically.',
    color: 'green' // syntax-green
  },
  {
    number: 3,
    title: '$ activate',
    description: 'Skills activate automatically in Claude when needed, extending capabilities seamlessly.',
    color: 'purple' // syntax-purple
  }
];
```

**Quick Start Command:**
```typescript
const INSTALL_COMMAND = 'npm install -g skills';
```

</section>
```

### Terminal Theme Styling

**Gradient Animation Keyframes:**
[Source: mockups/developer-cli/index.html:92-109]

```css
/* Add to frontend/src/index.css */

@keyframes gradient-shift {
  0% {
    background-position: 0% 50%;
  }
  50% {
    background-position: 100% 50%;
  }
  100% {
    background-position: 0% 50%;
  }
}

.mono-gradient-animated {
  background: linear-gradient(
    135deg,
    #61afef 0%,
    #56b6c2 25%,
    #98c379 50%,
    #56b6c2 75%,
    #61afef 100%
  );
  background-size: 200% 200%;
  animation: gradient-shift 5s ease-in-out infinite;
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
  background-clip: text;
  font-family: 'JetBrains Mono', monospace;
}
```

**Smooth Scroll Behavior:**
```css
/* Add to frontend/src/index.css */

html {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  html {
    scroll-behavior: auto;
  }
}
```

**Numbered Icon Component Styling:**
```css
/* Already supported by Tailwind, no custom CSS needed */

/* Example usage: */
<div className="w-12 h-12 bg-syntax-blue/10 border border-syntax-blue/30 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center">
  <span className="text-2xl font-mono text-syntax-blue font-bold">1</span>
</div>
```

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests (Vitest):**
[Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md:26-33]

Test each new component:
- **HowItWorksSection**: 3 cards render, numbered icons, titles, descriptions, responsive grid
- **QuickStartSection**: Terminal block renders, $ prompt, install command, CopyButton present
- **Home page**: All 6 sections render in correct order (Hero, Featured, Categories, HowItWorks, QuickStart, Footer)
- **Gradient animation**: CSS keyframes present in index.css (snapshot test)
- **Smooth scroll**: CSS rule present in index.css (snapshot test)

**Integration Tests (Vitest with React Router):**

Test homepage integration:
- Render Home page with all sections
- Verify section order
- Verify CopyButton in QuickStartSection copies install command
- Verify gradient heading has animation class

**Playwright Tests (MANDATORY):**
[Source: Claude.md:154-227]

CRITICAL: Use Playwright DURING development to verify components work:

1. **Gradient Animation:**
   - Navigate to homepage
   - Take snapshot at 0s (initial state)
   - Wait 3 seconds
   - Take snapshot at 3s (verify colors shifted)

2. **HowItWorksSection:**
   - Scroll to section
   - Verify 3 cards visible
   - Verify numbered icons (1 blue, 2 green, 3 purple)
   - Test responsive: 375px (stack), 1440px (3-column)

3. **QuickStartSection:**
   - Scroll to section
   - Verify terminal block visible
   - Verify $ prompt green
   - Click CopyButton → Verify checkmark animation
   - Verify clipboard contains install command

4. **Full Homepage:**
   - Full-page screenshot at 375px, 768px, 1440px
   - Verify all sections render
   - Test smooth scroll (scroll down → observe smooth animation)

5. **Performance:**
   - Run production build
   - Serve with `npx vite preview`
   - Verify bundle size <500 KB (gzipped)
   - Verify lazy-loaded chunks (if code splitting implemented)

### File Structure

**New Files to Create:**
- `frontend/src/components/sections/HowItWorksSection.tsx` - How It Works section
- `frontend/src/components/sections/QuickStartSection.tsx` - Quick Start terminal block
- `frontend/src/__tests__/components/sections/HowItWorksSection.test.tsx` - Unit tests
- `frontend/src/__tests__/components/sections/QuickStartSection.test.tsx` - Unit tests

**Files to Modify:**
- `frontend/src/components/sections/HeroSection.tsx` - Update heading className to use gradient animation
- `frontend/src/pages/Home.tsx` - Add HowItWorksSection and QuickStartSection
- `frontend/src/index.css` - Add gradient animation keyframes, smooth scroll CSS
- `frontend/README.md` - Document new sections, animations, performance optimizations

### Security Considerations

**No security concerns for Story 6.5** - all content is static and hardcoded:
- No user input processing
- No external data fetching
- No XSS vulnerabilities (static JSX content)
- CopyButton security already handled in Story 6.4 (clipboard API error handling)

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with Story 6.1-6.4:**
[Source: docs/stories/6.1.story.md, 6.2.story.md, 6.3.story.md, 6.4.story.md]

Story 6.5 extends the existing `frontend/` workspace:

**New Directory: `components/sections/` (homepage sections)**
```
frontend/src/components/sections/
├── HeroSection.tsx           # Existing from Story 6.3 (updated)
├── FeaturedSkillsSection.tsx # Existing from Story 6.3
├── CategoriesSection.tsx     # Existing from Story 6.3
├── HowItWorksSection.tsx     # NEW
└── QuickStartSection.tsx     # NEW
```

**Updated Files:**
- `pages/Home.tsx` - Adds 2 new sections (HowItWorks, QuickStart)
- `index.css` - Adds animation keyframes and smooth scroll

**No Structural Conflicts:**
- All changes are additive (new components and CSS)
- No modifications to existing CLI workspace or AO registry process
- Builds on infrastructure from Story 6.1-6.4
- Follows React component patterns
- Follows Tailwind CSS conventions

**Story Status**: Ready for Review

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-24

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Quality: Excellent**

Story 6.5 demonstrates professional-grade implementation with clean component architecture, comprehensive testing, and production-ready optimizations. The code follows React best practices, leverages shadcn-ui components appropriately, and maintains consistency with the established codebase patterns from Stories 6.1-6.4.

**Strengths:**
- Clean, focused components with single responsibility principle
- Excellent TypeScript typing and interface definitions
- Comprehensive unit test coverage (14 new tests, 100% passing)
- Professional documentation in component headers
- Proper separation of concerns (sections, styling, data)
- Accessibility considerations (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)

**Notable Implementation Quality:**
- HowItWorksSection: Data-driven design with HOW_IT_WORKS_STEPS array
- QuickStartSection: Clean integration of existing CopyButton component
- CSS animations: GPU-optimized (transform/opacity), accessibility-aware (prefers-reduced-motion)
- Code splitting: React.lazy() implementation reduces initial bundle by 94%

### Refactoring Performed

**No refactoring performed** - Code quality already meets production standards.

The implementation is clean, maintainable, and follows established patterns. The developer (James) has consistently applied best practices throughout the story execution.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ PASS
  - TypeScript strict mode compliance
  - ESLint/Prettier formatting consistent
  - Naming conventions: PascalCase components, camelCase functions
  - No console.log usage detected in production code

- **Project Structure**: ✓ PASS
  - New components in correct locations (`components/sections/`)
  - Test files follow pattern (`__tests__/components/sections/*.test.tsx`)
  - Proper imports and module organization
  - Aligns with source tree from Stories 6.1-6.4

- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ PASS
  - Unit tests for both new components (7 tests each)
  - Test naming follows Given-When-Then semantics
  - Proper use of testing-library queries (getByRole, getByText)
  - Mock setup for clipboard API in QuickStartSection tests

- **All ACs Met**: ✓ PASS (8 acceptance criteria)
  1. ✓ Animated gradient heading (5s animation, 135deg, 5 color stops)
  2. ✓ How It Works section (3 numbered cards with icons)
  3. ✓ Quick Start terminal block ($ prompt, CopyButton integration)
  4. ✓ Polished animations and transitions (hover effects, smooth timing)
  5. ✓ Smooth scroll behavior (CSS, prefers-reduced-motion)
  6. ✓ Responsive design verified (375px/768px/1440px via Playwright)
  7. ✓ Playwright verification during development (screenshots in .playwright-mcp/)
  8. ✓ Performance optimization (code splitting: 68KB initial bundle)

### Improvements Checklist

**All Critical Items Addressed:**

- [x] Animated gradient heading implemented with proper keyframes
- [x] HowItWorksSection created with responsive grid and hover effects
- [x] QuickStartSection created with terminal styling and CopyButton
- [x] Smooth scroll CSS added with accessibility support
- [x] Code splitting implemented (React.lazy, Suspense)
- [x] Responsive testing completed at all breakpoints
- [x] Production build successful (31.41s, all chunks generated)
- [x] Comprehensive unit tests written (14 tests, 100% passing)

**Advisory Recommendations (Non-Blocking):**

- [ ] **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Investigate ErrorMessage chunk size (3MB / 935KB gzipped)
  - Current: ErrorMessage-CBOw5GNR.js is 3.17MB (935KB gzipped)
  - Likely cause: Large dependency (possibly MarkdownRenderer or syntax highlighting library)
  - Recommendation: Analyze bundle with `vite-bundle-visualizer` to identify heavy dependencies
  - Impact: Non-blocking for Story 6.5 (lazy-loaded, not on critical path)
  - Suggested action: Create technical debt ticket for Epic 7 or future optimization sprint

- [ ] **LOW PRIORITY**: Add Lighthouse performance audit to CI/CD
  - Target: >90 Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices scores
  - Current: Manual verification only (via Playwright screenshots)
  - Benefit: Automated performance regression detection

- [ ] **LOW PRIORITY**: Consider Intersection Observer for How It Works cards
  - Current: Cards visible immediately (no lazy loading)
  - Enhancement: Fade-in animation when scrolling into viewport
  - Benefit: Enhanced user experience with progressive reveal
  - Note: AC 4 mentions "fade-in animations" as optional enhancement

### Security Review

**Security Status: PASS (No Concerns)**

Story 6.5 involves only static content rendering with no security-sensitive operations:

- ✓ No user input processing (hardcoded static content)
- ✓ No external data fetching (all content embedded in components)
- ✓ No XSS vulnerabilities (static JSX, no dangerouslySetInnerHTML)
- ✓ CopyButton security inherited from Story 6.4 (clipboard API error handling)
- ✓ No authentication, authorization, or session management
- ✓ No secrets, API keys, or sensitive data handling

**Clipboard API Usage:**
- Proper error handling in CopyButton component (from Story 6.4)
- HTTPS requirement documented (clipboard API restrictions)
- User-initiated action required (button click)

### Performance Considerations

**Performance Status: EXCELLENT**

**Bundle Size Analysis:**
```
Initial bundle: 68.35 KB gzipped (94% reduction from 1MB baseline)
Home chunk: 3.88 KB gzipped
SearchResults: 1.46 KB gzipped
SkillDetail: 8.39 KB gzipped
```

**Optimization Achievements:**
1. ✓ Code splitting implemented (React.lazy + Suspense)
2. ✓ Route-based chunking (Home, SearchResults, SkillDetail, NotFound)
3. ✓ Initial bundle well under 500 KB target (68KB << 500KB)
4. ✓ GPU-accelerated animations (transform, opacity, no layout thrashing)
5. ✓ Smooth scroll with accessibility override (prefers-reduced-motion)

**Animation Performance:**
- Gradient shift: 5s duration, ease-in-out (smooth, no jank)
- Card hover: transform scale (GPU-accelerated)
- All transitions use `transition-all` or `transition-transform` (Tailwind optimized)
- No width/height animations (avoids reflow)

**Identified Issue (Non-Blocking):**
- ⚠️ ErrorMessage chunk: 3.17 MB (935 KB gzipped)
  - **Root cause**: Likely large dependency in MarkdownRenderer or syntax highlighting
  - **Impact**: Medium (lazy-loaded, only affects skill detail page)
  - **Recommendation**: Analyze with vite-bundle-visualizer, consider:
    - Dynamic import for MarkdownRenderer
    - Lighter syntax highlighting library
    - Manual chunk splitting for markdown-related dependencies

**Lighthouse Targets (Advisory):**
- Performance: Target >90 (not measured in this review)
- Accessibility: Target >90 (semantic HTML used, ARIA labels present)
- Best Practices: Target >90 (React best practices followed)
