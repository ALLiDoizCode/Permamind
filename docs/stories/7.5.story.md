# Story 7.5: Fix Inconsistent GenerateLuaProcess Tool Usage for AO Process Creation

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** user, **I want** the system to consistently route AO process creation requests to the `generateLuaProcess` tool **so that** I get proper documentation-informed Lua code generation instead of inconsistent tool routing.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All user requests for "create AO process", "generate AO process", "build AO process" should consistently use `generateLuaProcess` tool
2. Tool routing logic should prioritize `generateLuaProcess` for Lua code generation requests over legacy process tools
3. Tool selection should be deterministic and predictable based on user intent keywords
4. Tool routing should include fallback logic when `generateLuaProcess` is not suitable
5. Routing decisions should be logged for debugging and improvement

## Dev Notes

### Issue Analysis

- **Current Problem**: Users requesting AO process creation aren't consistently routed to `generateLuaProcess` tool
- **Tool Location**: `src/tools/process/commands/GenerateLuaProcessCommand.ts`
- **Tool Registration**: Properly registered in `ProcessToolFactory.ts`
- **Root Cause**: MCP server tool routing/selection logic not properly detecting when to use `generateLuaProcess`

### Technical Context

- **GenerateLuaProcess Tool**: Uses `LuaWorkflowOrchestrationService` for documentation-informed code generation
- **Tool Factory**: `ProcessToolFactory` contains both `GenerateLuaProcess` and legacy tools
- **Routing Issue**: Tool selection happens at MCP server level, not tool factory level

### Implementation Requirements

- Review MCP server tool routing logic in `src/server.ts`
- Add keyword detection for process creation requests
- Update tool metadata/hints to improve routing
- Add logging for tool selection decisions
- Test routing with various user request patterns

### File Locations

- Tool Command: `src/tools/process/commands/GenerateLuaProcessCommand.ts`
- Tool Factory: `src/tools/process/ProcessToolFactory.ts`

## QA Results

### Review Date: August 18, 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT** - The implementation successfully addresses tool routing inconsistencies through strategic metadata optimization. The approach is elegant, leveraging FastMCP's algorithmic tool selection rather than attempting to modify the MCP server routing logic directly.

**Key Strengths:**

- Well-structured keyword-based metadata that clearly differentiates tool purposes
- Comprehensive logging for debugging tool selection decisions
- Strong separation of concerns between `generateLuaProcess` (code generation) and `spawnProcess` (empty process creation)
- Excellent test coverage with both unit and integration tests
- Clean, maintainable implementation that follows existing patterns

### Refactoring Performed

None required - the code is well-structured and follows established patterns.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All code follows TypeScript strict mode, proper imports, and formatting
- Project Structure: ✓ Files properly organized in tool factory pattern
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit and integration tests with proper mocking
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested
