## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 8.3 (AO Development Specialists):

- Successfully implemented AO development specialists with comprehensive tool integration
- Created specialized agents "ao-developer" (Aria) and "permaweb-qa" (Sage) with AO-specific expertise
- Enhanced tool patterns include proper integration with spawnProcess, evalProcess, executeAction, queryPermawebDocs
- All tasks completed with 100% test coverage (25 new tests passing)
- Agent collaboration workflows support efficient handoffs with file-based context transfer
- Type safety maintained with proper TypeScript interface extensions

Key insight: Story 8.4 builds on the proven AO specialist infrastructure from Story 8.3, enhancing agents with aolite testing knowledge to enable comprehensive local testing before live deployment using existing AOLite service infrastructure.

### Data Models

**AOLite Agent Integration** [Source: src/models/AOLiteTest.ts and existing service patterns]:

```typescript
// Existing AOLiteTestConfiguration remains unchanged
// Agents will use existing interface for test execution
interface AOLiteTestConfiguration {
  concurrent?: boolean;
  coverage?: boolean;
  maxConcurrency?: number;
  retries?: number;
  timeout?: number;
  verbose?: boolean;
}

// Agent-friendly test result interpretation
interface AOLiteAgentTestResults extends AOLiteTestResults {
  summary: {
    passed: number;
    failed: number;
    total: number;
    duration: number;
  };
  recommendations?: string[];
  nextSteps?: string[];
}
```

### Agent Workflow Integration

**Agent Testing Workflow** [Source: existing AOLiteTestService.ts and agent patterns]:

```typescript
// Agents will use existing AOLiteTestService methods
// Enhanced workflow pattern for agents:
// 1. spawnProcess() - Create test process
// 2. evalProcess() - Deploy Lua code
// 3. generateAoliteTests() - Agent generates test specifications
// 4. executeAoliteTests() - Use existing AOLiteTestService
// 5. interpretResults() - Agent analyzes results and provides recommendations

// Agent test generation guidance
interface AgentTestGenerationContext {
  processId: string;
  processDescription: string;
  expectedBehaviors: string[];
  handlerFunctions: string[];
  testScenarios: string[];
}
```
