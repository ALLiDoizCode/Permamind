# Story 8.5: Ensure Generated Processes are ADP-Compliant - Brownfield Fix

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** user creating AO processes via evalProcess, **I want** my deployed processes to be ADP-compliant **so that** the executeAction tool can discover and communicate with them successfully.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: evalProcess tool, generateLuaProcess tool, DocumentationProtocolService
- Technology: TypeScript + AO Connect + Lua code generation + ADP v1.0 specification
- Follows pattern: ADP-compliant process structure with Info handler and proper metadata
- Touch points: Process deployment, ADP metadata generation, Info handler implementation

**Issue Context:**

QA testing revealed that manually deployed calculator processes (via evalProcess) may not be generating proper ADP-compliant Info responses. The executeAction tool expects ADP metadata for process discovery, but deployed processes might not be providing the structured data required for ADP detection and handler discovery.

**Analysis Required:**

1. Check if evalProcess-deployed code includes proper ADP Info handler
2. Verify ADP metadata format matches DocumentationProtocolService expectations
3. Ensure generateLuaProcess tool creates ADP-compliant code
4. Test ADP compliance detection in executeAction discovery phase

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Processes deployed via evalProcess include proper ADP Info handler
2. Info handler returns valid ADP v1.0 compliant metadata structure
3. ADP metadata includes complete handler registry with actions, parameters, descriptions
4. Generated processes include protocolVersion: "1.0" for ADP detection
5. Handler metadata format matches DocumentationProtocolService parsing expectations

**Integration Requirements:**

6. executeAction ADP discovery successfully detects evalProcess-deployed processes as ADP-compliant
7. DocumentationProtocolService.parseInfoResponse() correctly parses generated metadata
8. generateLuaProcess tool produces ADP-compliant code with proper Info handlers
9. Manual evalProcess deployments can include ADP compliance template
10. Integration with existing DocumentationProtocolService ADP implementation

**Quality Requirements:**

11. ADP compliance verification tests with real process deployment and discovery
12. Template validation ensures all generated processes follow ADP specification
13. No regression in existing process creation or deployment functionality
14. Generated ADP metadata is complete and accurate for all handlers

### Key Service Integration Points

**LuaCodeGeneratorService.ts** (`src/services/LuaCodeGeneratorService.ts`):

- Contains existing Lua code generation logic
- Needs enhancement to inject ADP Info handlers into all generated processes
- Must ensure generated metadata matches DocumentationProtocolService parsing expectations
- Current method: `generateProcessCode()` - needs ADP template integration

**DocumentationProtocolService.ts** (`src/services/DocumentationProtocolService.ts`):

- Already implements full ADP v1.0 specification parsing
- Methods: `parseInfoResponse()`, `isADPCompliant()`, `validateParameters()`
- Generated metadata must match expected format from this service
- Reference implementation for ADP compliance validation

**ExecuteActionCommand.ts** (`src/tools/process/commands/ExecuteActionCommand.ts`):

- Current ADP discovery implementation using DocumentationProtocolService
- Integration testing target: manually deployed processes should be detected as ADP-compliant
- Cache mechanism (adpCache) for ADP responses - needs validation with generated processes

### ADP Specification Requirements (specs/adp-specification.md)

**Required ADP Response Structure:**

```json
{
  "protocolVersion": "1.0",
  "lastUpdated": "ISO-8601-timestamp",
  "handlers": [
    {
      "action": "HandlerName",
      "pattern": ["Action"],
      "tags": [
        /* tag definitions */
      ],
      "description": "Handler description",
      "category": "core|utility|custom"
    }
  ],
  "capabilities": {
    "supportsHandlerRegistry": true,
    "supportsTagValidation": true,
    "supportsExamples": true
  }
}
```

**Critical Implementation Notes:**

- All generated processes must include `protocolVersion: "1.0"` for ADP detection
- Handler metadata must include complete tag definitions with types and requirements
- Template must be compatible with existing Lua process patterns
- Backward compatibility with non-ADP processes must be maintained

### Coordination with Story 8.3

This story coordinates with Story 8.3 (GenerateLuaProcess tool enhancement). Key coordination points:

- Story 8.3 handles functional code generation improvements
- Story 8.5 focuses specifically on ADP compliance for all generated processes
- Both stories modify LuaCodeGeneratorService.ts - changes must be compatible
- Integration testing must verify both functional improvements and ADP compliance

### Testing Standards

**Test File Locations:** Follow existing pattern in `tests/` directory

- Unit tests: `tests/unit/services/` for service-level testing
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/` for end-to-end workflow testing
- Naming convention: `*.unit.test.ts` and `*.integration.test.ts`

**Testing Frameworks:** Use existing Vitest framework

- Import pattern: `import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach, vi } from "vitest"`
- Mock external dependencies using `vi.mock()`
- Test file must include comprehensive ADP workflow testing

**Required Test Scenarios:**

- Manual deployment via evalProcess with ADP template → executeAction discovery
- Generated process via generateLuaProcess → ADP compliance validation
- Integration with DocumentationProtocolService parsing
- Error handling for malformed ADP responses
- Backward compatibility with existing non-ADP processes

**Build Validation:** All changes must pass existing quality gates

- `npm run build` - TypeScript compilation
- `npm run lint` - Code linting with ESLint
- `npm run type-check` - Type checking validation
- `npm run test` - Complete test suite execution

## Technical Notes

**Integration Approach:** Ensure all process deployment paths (evalProcess manual deployment, generateLuaProcess automated generation) produce ADP-compliant processes with proper Info handlers and metadata structure.

**Existing Pattern Reference:** ADP specification in specs/adp-specification.md, DocumentationProtocolService implementation, existing Info handler patterns

**Key Constraints:** Must work with both manual evalProcess deployments and automated generateLuaProcess generation, maintain compatibility with legacy non-ADP processes

**Implementation Areas:**

1. **ADP Template Creation** (`src/templates/adp-info-handler.lua`)
   - Create reusable Lua template with proper ADP v1.0 structure
   - Include dynamic handler registry generation
   - Ensure compatibility with existing process patterns

2. **Service Integration** (`src/services/LuaCodeGeneratorService.ts`)
   - Modify existing code generation to inject ADP templates
   - Add metadata generation based on detected process patterns
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality

3. **Validation Layer** (`src/services/ADPValidationService.ts`)
   - Create new service for ADP compliance validation
   - Implement metadata completeness checking
   - Add integration with existing DocumentationProtocolService

4. **Integration Testing** (`tests/integration/ADPComplianceWorkflow.integration.test.ts`)
   - End-to-end testing of ADP workflow
   - Validation of executeAction tool integration
   - Regression testing for existing functionality

**Critical Success Factors:**

- All generated processes must be detectable by executeAction ADP discovery
- Metadata format must exactly match DocumentationProtocolService expectations
- Manual deployment templates must be easy to use and well-documented
- No breaking changes to existing process creation workflows

## Definition of Done

- [ ] evalProcess deployments can optionally include ADP-compliant Info handler
- [ ] Manual calculator deployment with proper ADP Info handler works with executeAction
- [ ] ADP metadata format exactly matches DocumentationProtocolService expectations
- [ ] executeAction ADP discovery successfully detects manually deployed processes
- [ ] generateLuaProcess tool produces ADP-compliant code (coordinates with Story 8.3)
- [ ] Integration tests verify full ADP workflow: deploy → discover → communicate
- [ ] ADP compliance template available for manual process development
- [ ] Build passes: npm run build && npm run lint && npm run type-check && npm run test

## Risk and Compatibility

**Primary Risk:** Breaking existing process deployment patterns or non-ADP process support

**Mitigation:** Make ADP compliance optional for manual deployments, maintain legacy process support

**Rollback:** Remove ADP templates from deployment tools, revert to existing deployment patterns
