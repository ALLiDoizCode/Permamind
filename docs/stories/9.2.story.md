# Story 9.2: Implement Parameter Validation and Error Handling - Brownfield Enhancement

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** developer debugging AO process communication, **I want** comprehensive logging and validation of parameter translation **so that** I can identify and fix communication failures quickly.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: ADPProcessCommunicationService, ExecuteActionCommand, logging infrastructure
- Technology: TypeScript + FastMCP + AO Connect + existing error handling patterns
- Follows pattern: Existing error handling in ProcessToolFactory and service layer
- Touch points: Parameter validation middleware, logging systems, error response formatting

**Issue Context:**

While Story 9.1 fixed core parameter extraction patterns, debugging parameter translation failures remains challenging for developers. The current system lacks comprehensive logging of the parameter translation pipeline, making it difficult to identify where translations fail and why. When extraction fails, error messages are generic and don't provide actionable debugging information.

**Root Cause Analysis:**

1. **Limited Debug Visibility:** No comprehensive logging of parameter translation steps (raw request → extracted parameters → generated tags)
2. **Generic Error Messages:** Current errors lack specific failure reasons and suggested fixes
3. **Validation Gaps:** Parameter validation happens too late in the pipeline, after message sending attempts
4. **Missing Contract Testing:** No validation that extracted parameters match process handler expectations

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Add detailed logging for each step of parameter translation: raw request → extracted parameters → generated tags
2. Implement parameter validation middleware that catches translation failures before sending messages
3. Provide clear, actionable error messages when parameter extraction fails

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing error handling patterns in ProcessToolFactory continue to work unchanged
5. New logging follows existing structured logging patterns in the codebase
6. Integration with current MCP error response formatting maintains compatibility

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Parameter validation is covered by comprehensive unit tests with various failure scenarios
8. Logging output is structured and includes context for debugging
9. No performance regression in successful parameter translation paths verified

[Source: CLAUDE.md#L146-150]

**Test Scenarios to Cover:**

- Parameter validation failure scenarios for each parameter type
- Error message generation for different failure categories
- Logging output verification for parameter translation steps
- Contract validation between extracted parameters and handler expectations
- Retry mechanism testing with various failure patterns
- Performance impact verification for successful translation paths

### Technical Constraints

**Performance Requirements:**

- No performance regression in successful parameter translation paths
- Validation middleware must have minimal overhead for valid parameters
- Debug logging must be conditional (development mode only)
- Error handling additions must not impact successful operation latency

**TypeScript Requirements:**

- Strict mode compliance with explicit typing for all new interfaces
- Proper error handling with meaningful error messages
- ES modules with `.js` extensions for local imports
- Interface definitions for new validation and logging structures

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#L1-31]

**Integration Constraints:**

- Must maintain existing ExecuteActionCommand error response format
- Cannot break existing ADPProcessCommunicationService API interface
- New logging must follow existing console.log development patterns
- Parameter validation must integrate seamlessly with current extraction logic

**Error Handling Standards:**

- Comprehensive try-catch blocks with meaningful error messages
- Proper error propagation and logging
- Graceful failure management with actionable feedback

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#L19-23]

### Current Logging and Error Handling Architecture

**Existing Debug Logging (ADPProcessCommunicationService.ts:294-298):**

```typescript
private static debugLog(message: string, data?: any): void {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
    console.log(`[ADPParameterExtraction] ${message}`, data || "");
  }
}
```

**Current Error Categories:**

1. **ADP Discovery Failures**: "Process does not support ADP or discovery failed"
2. **Handler Matching Failures**: "Could not match request to any available ADP handler"
3. **Parameter Validation Failures**: "Parameter validation failed: [specific errors]"
4. **Execution Failures**: "ADP execution failed: [error message]"

[Source: src/services/ADPProcessCommunicationService.ts#L119-207]

**Current Parameter Validation Logic:**

- Type validation for number, string, boolean, address types
- Range checking for numeric values (-1000000 to 1000000)
- Required parameter validation with null/undefined checks
- Address format validation using regex patterns

[Source: src/services/ADPProcessCommunicationService.ts#L680-743]

### Enhancement Opportunities

1. Add structured logging for each translation pipeline step
2. Include request metadata (processId, timestamp, handler context)
3. Log parameter extraction details with success/failure indicators
4. Add performance metrics for debugging slow extractions

**Validation Enhancements:**

1. Implement middleware pattern for early validation
2. Add contract testing against handler metadata
3. Create parameter type coercion with validation
