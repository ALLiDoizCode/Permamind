# AO Registry Configuration (Optional Overrides for Testing/Development)
#
# The registry configuration is now baked into the application.
# You DO NOT need to set these variables for production use.
#
# These environment variables are only needed if you want to:
# - Test against a different registry process
# - Use alternative CU/MU endpoints
# - Point to a custom HyperBEAM node
#
# Production defaults (used if not set):
# - VITE_REGISTRY_PROCESS_ID: afj-S1wpWK07iSs9jIttoPJsptf4Db6ubZ_CLODdEpQ
# - VITE_MU_URL: https://ur-mu.randao.net
# - VITE_CU_URL: https://ur-cu.randao.net
# - VITE_HYPERBEAM_NODE: https://hb-edge.randao.net
