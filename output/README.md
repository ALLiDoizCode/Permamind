**"How does it work?"**
```
Skills are packaged as tar.gz bundles:
1. Published once to Arweave (permanent)
2. Indexed in AO registry (decentralized)
3. Installed anywhere, anytime

Like npm, but permanent and decentralized!

Docs: github.com/permamind/skills
```

**"What's the cost?"**
```
Publishing: ~$0.05/MB one-time to Arweave
Installing: Free forever
Storage: 200+ years guaranteed

No subscriptions, no recurring fees.
```

**"Does this work with [other AI]?"**
```
Currently built for Claude Agent Skills.

Storage layer (Arweave) + registry (AO) are model-agnostic, so adapters for other models are possible!
