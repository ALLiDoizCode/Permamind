# X Thread: Agent Skills & Permamind

## Thread Structure

### Tweet 1: The Hook (Main Thread)
```
🧠 What if Claude could remember your entire tech stack across sessions?

Introducing Agent Skills + Permamind: The decentralized registry that turns Claude into a domain expert.

### Tweet 2: The Problem
```
❌ Traditional AI agents forget everything between sessions
❌ You repeat the same context over and over
❌ Each project requires rebuilding expertise from scratch

Sound familiar?

There's a better way.
```

### Tweet 3: What Are Agent Skills?
```
Agent Skills = Modular expertise packages that Claude loads automatically

Think of them as "onboarding guides" for AI agents.

Built by Anthropic, they use progressive disclosure:
• Level 1: Metadata (~100 tokens)
• Level 2: Instructions (<5k tokens)
• Level 3: Resources (loaded as needed)
```

### Tweet 4: The Magic of Progressive Loading
```
$ claude load skill ao-development
✓ Metadata loaded (98 tokens)
✓ Skill activated on demand
✓ Resources load only when needed

No context bloat. No repeated explanations.
Just expertise, when you need it.
```

### Tweet 5: The Problem with Centralization
```
But there's a catch...

Agent Skills are platform-specific:
• Claude API ≠ Claude Code ≠ Claude.ai
• No cross-platform sync
• Walled gardens

Your expertise shouldn't be locked in.
```
**Visual**: Terminal showing "SYNC FAILED" across different platforms
